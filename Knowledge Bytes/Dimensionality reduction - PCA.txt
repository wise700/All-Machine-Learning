PCA

1. Analysis of data to identify patterns and finding patterns to reduce the dimensions 
   of the dataset with minimal loss of information.

2.  Our desired outcome of the principal component analysis is to project a feature space (our dataset consisting of n d-dimensional samples) 
    onto a smaller subspace (with k dimensions where k<d) that represents our data “well”

3. Compute Eigen values of given datset, sort them decendingly and chosse the top k dimensions.

4. Use this d×k eigenvector matrix to transform the samples onto the new subspace.

5. Its like looking from the orthogona side. then all points will be mapped to that orthogonal plane.

6. Say we have 20 features and u do PCA for 2 features and look out for the % of variance explained. if its high we can basically train with
   these two features only.
