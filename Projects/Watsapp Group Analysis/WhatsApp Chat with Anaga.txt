3/15/20, 12:16 PM - Nagendra: An American film that was released in 2011 speaks of "Coronavirus" virus  that begins spreading from China to the rest of the world! The strangest thing is that at the end of the movie it turns out that the cause of infection is the bat, which is the  same reason that the  disease is currently  spread! The name of the film is "Contagion" and it stars Matt  Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow &  Kate Winslet. Yes it was prophetic! 😎

3/19/20, 11:20 AM - Vishak: Now here is an interesting conspiracy theory if you want:
Impact of coronavirus on stock exchanges worldwide, within 1 month: 

 🇺🇸 -26%
 🇬🇧 -26%
 🇨🇦 -25%
 🇧🇷 -27%
 🇷🇺 -20%
 🇦🇪 -19%
 🇿🇦 -16%
 🇦🇺 -24%
 🇮🇳 -14%
 🇸🇬 -17%
 🇭🇰 -12%
 🇰🇷 - 17%

Now, look at this: 

 🇨🇳 (China) + 0,3%

China, creator of the pandemic, has miraculously "recovered", has almost no more cases of coronavirus.  The world is now beginning to feel the effects and panic about the disease.  Who recovered first ??  China itself!  It seems to be that this virus was a move by the Chinese government in response to the loss of the trade war with the United States.  The goal: to throw the world into recession !!!
Is the scenario not clear?  They are already growing!  China bought almost everything it devalued on the stock exchanges around the world ... with that the Chinese became owners of the global companies that are in China and without the money leaving China.

3/21/20, 10:06 PM - Nagendra: What is the answer
3/21/20, 10:08 PM - Anni jss: While he or anybody who passed through airport, they were checked with that temperature gun. That time he might be not having high fever or any symptoms. he was told to be in home 'home quarantine'. He would have felt, I was checked, I dint show any symptoms, I'm fine and has roamed everywhere
3/21/20, 10:09 PM - Nagendra: No
3/21/20, 10:09 PM - Nagendra: He went from airport to hospital
3/21/20, 10:09 PM - Nagendra: So he must have had symptoms
3/21/20, 10:09 PM - Anni jss: He said, once anyone passed through airports, whether they showed symptoms or not, they should have been put in quarantine in govt facility
3/21/20, 10:10 PM - Anni jss: There could have been a lapse, but if symptoms were shown all of them have been kept in quarantine
3/21/20, 10:10 PM - Nagendra: Yeah lapse is there..
3/21/20, 10:11 PM - Anni jss: Mistake was, letting anyone passing through airport to their homes instead of govt quarantine

Copied:-
This is from an immunologist at Johns Hopkins University:

Feeling confused as to why Coronavirus is a bigger deal than Seasonal flu?  Here it is in a nutshell.   I hope this helps.  Feel free to share this to others who don’t understand...   

It has to do with RNA sequencing....  I.e. genetics.

Seasonal flu is an “all human virus”.  The DNA/RNA chains that make up the virus are recognized by the human immune system.  This means that your body has some immunity to it before it comes around each year...  you get immunity two ways...through exposure to a virus, or by getting a flu shot.  

Novel viruses, come from animals....  the WHO tracks novel viruses in animals, (sometimes for years watching for mutations). Usually these viruses only transfer from animal to animal (pigs in the case of H1N1) (birds in the case of the Spanish flu).  But once, one of these animal viruses mutates, and starts to transfer from animals to humans... then it’s a problem,  Why? Because we have no natural or acquired immunity.. the RNA sequencing of the genes inside the virus isn’t human, and the human immune system doesn’t recognize it so, we can’t fight it off. 

Now.... sometimes, the mutation only allows transfer from animal to human, for years it’s only transmission is  from an infected animal to a human before  it finally mutates so that it can now transfer human to human... once that happens..we have a new contagion phase.  And depending on the fashion of this new mutation, thats what decides how contagious, or how deadly it’s gonna be..

H1N1 was deadly....but it did not mutate in a way that was as deadly as the Spanish flu.    It’s RNA was slower to mutate and it attacked its host differently, too.  

Fast forward. 

Now, here comes this Coronavirus... it existed in animals only, for nobody knows how long...but one day, at an animal market, in Wuhan China, in December 2019, it mutated and made the jump from animal to people.  At first, only animals could give it to a person... But here is the scary part.... in just TWO WEEKS it mutated again and gained the ability to jump from human to human.   Scientists call this quick ability, “slippery”

This Coronavirus, not being in any form a “human” virus (whereas we would all have some natural or acquired immunity). Took off like a rocket.  And this was because, Humans have no known immunity...doctors have no known medicines for it.

And it just so happens that this particular mutated animal virus, changed itself in such a way the way that it causes great damage to human lungs..

That’s why Coronavirus is different from seasonal flu, or H1N1 or any other type of influenza....  this one is slippery AF.   And it’s a lung eater...And, it’s already mutated AGAIN, so that we now have two strains to deal with, strain s, and strain L....which makes it twice as hard to develop a vaccine.

We really have no tools in our shed, with this.  History has shown that fast and immediate closings of public places has helped in the past pandemics.  Philadelphia and Baltimore were reluctant to close events in 1918 and they were the hardest hit in the US during the Spanish Flu. 

Factoid:  Henry VIII stayed in his room and allowed no one near him, till the Black Plague passed...(honestly...I understand him so much better now). Just like us, he had no tools in his shed, except social isolation...

And let me end by saying....right now it’s hitting older folks harder... but this genome is so slippery...if it mutates again (and it will). Who is to say, what it will do next.  

Be smart folks...  acting like you’re unafraid is so not sexy right now.  

#flattenthecurve.  Stay home folks...  and share this to those that just are not catching on.  🤓

3/24/20, 9:46 PM - Vishak: Belgium Health minister has put a ban on all sexual activities of three people or more after a coronavirus party last week turned into a 500-participant orgy and ended with 380 cases of contamination.

“Wife swapping, threesomes, and orgies of six, fifty, one hundred or more are not permitted until the outbreak settles down,” she announced in Parliament.

Health minister De Block did not ban single or two-person sexual practices such as masturbation, anal or oral sex, or even bestiality.

3/24/20, 10:10 PM - Bhavan Play: *WELL PLAYED CHINA....* 

*SCENE 1 :*
The curtain opens: China becomes ill, enters a "crisis" and paralyzes its trade.  The curtain closes.

*SCENE II.*  
The curtain opens: The Chinese currency is devalued.  They do not do anything.  The curtain closes.

*SCENE III.*  
The curtain opens:: Due to the lack of trade of companies from Europe and the USA that are based in China, their shares fall 40% of their value.

*SCENE IV.*  
The curtain opens:: The world is ill, China buys 30% of the shares of companies in Europe and the US at a very low price.  The curtain closes.

*SCENE V.* 
The curtain opens: China has controlled the disease and owns companies in Europe and the US.  And he decides that these companies stay in China and earn $ 20,000Billions.  The curtain closes.  How is the play called?

 *SCENE  VI:* 
 *Checkmate!*

 *ReAmazing but true* 

Two videos have passed between yesterday and today that convinced me of something I suspected, but had no basis.  It was just my speculation.  Now I am convinced that the coronavirus was purposely propagated by the Chinese themselves.

 At first they were too prepared.  Three weeks after the start of the roll, 14 days and a 12,000-bed hospitals were already under construction.  And they really built them in two weeks.  

Awesome.

Yesterday they announced that they had stopped the epidemic.  They appear in videos celebrating, they announce that they even have a vaccine.  How could they create it so quickly without having all the genetic information?  Well if you are the owner of the formula it is not difficult at all.
 And today I just saw a video that explains how Den Xiao Ping gave the west a half stick.  Due to the coronavirus, the actions of Western companies in China fell dramatically.  China I just hope, when they went down enough they bought them.  Now the companies, Created by the USA and Europe in China with all the technology put in by these exchanges and their capital they passed into the hands of China, which is now rising with all that technological potential and will be able to set prices at will to sell everything they need to the West.  How are you?

 None of this could have happened by chance.  China who cared that a few old men died?  Fewer old-age pensions to pay, but the loot has been huge.  And right now the West is financially defeated, in crisis and stunned by the disease.  And without knowing what to do.

Masterfully diabolic.  It had to be the communists.  |

Adding to this, they are now the single largest owners of US treasury with 1.18 trillion holding surpassing Japan. 
An instrument that has seen the most rally

One ☝ prospective & Analogy
-------_--------------_-------////-//////
 How come Russia & North Korea have Low or Zero incidence of Covid- 19 ? 

Is it because they are staunch allies of China

On the other hand USA / South Korea / United Kingdom / France / Italy / Spain and Asia are severely hit

How come Wuhan is suddenly free from the deadly virus? 

China says that the drastic initial measures that they took were very stern and Wuhan was locked down to contain the spread to other areas

Why Beijing was not hit ? Why only Wuhan? 

It is interesting to ponder upon.. right ? 

Well ..Wuhan is open for business now

Covid - 19 needs to be seen in the backdrop of the arm twisting of China by USA in the trade war

America and all the above mentioned countries are devastated financially 

Soon American economy will collapse as planned by China. 

China knows it CANNOT defeat America militarily as USA is at present THE MOST POWERFUL country in the world. 

So use the virus...to cripple the economy and paralyse the nation and its Defense capabilities. 

I am sure Nancy Pelosi got a part in this.... to topple Trump.... 

Lately President Trump  has always been telling of how the GREAT American economy was improving on all fronts and jobs were coming back to the USA

The only way to destroy his vision of making AMERICA GREAT AGAIN is to create an ECONOMIC HAVOC. 

Nancy Pelosi was unable to bring down Trump through impeachment.....so work along with China to destroy Trump by releasing a virus.

Wuhan's epidemic was a showcase. 

At the peak of the virus epidemic....China's President Xi Jinping...just wore a simple RM1 facemask to visit those effected areas. 

As President he should have been covered from head to toe.....but that was not the case.

He was already injected to resist any harm from the virus....that means a cure was already in place before the virus was released

China's vision is to control the World ECONOMY by buying up stocks now from countries facing the brink of severe ECONOMIC COLLAPSE.....Later China will announce that their Medical Researchers have found a cure to destroy the virus

Now China shall OWN  the stocks of All Western Alliances and these countries will soon be slave to their NEW MASTER..... CHINA

3/28/20, 9:27 PM - Vishak: Why Japan is normal when the entire world is shutdown??

This is an experience written by an Indian student in Japan

I am continously thinking when Japan was the first country to be impacted by Corona from China because of the luxury ship Diamond Princess from China in January by now it would have gone to stage 4 like European countries. When Japan was hit with the Virus, My parents asked me to come back to India for few months and go back once it settles. 
But in Japan everything is normal till today. We were going to offices daily, we are going to all essential services. No restaurants are closed. No malls are closed. No lockdown. Metro trains moving normally. Bullet trains moving normally. All International borders are open. Also Japan has the high percentage of old people like Italy. Tokyo has highest number of foreigners living. Tokyo is one of the best tourist attraction with lot of foreigners. Foreigners are still allowed inside. 
Only services stopped are schools and public events. 
Am listening to all theories of breaking the chain.
Lockdown kills the chain process for the dense country like India. Tokyo is the most dense city in the world and how is it controlled. We are leading just the normal life as usual. Am Only scared when i see updates and news from India. 

I analyzed about it and probably it is because of the culture of Japanese people where the rules suggested to prevent Corona virus were practiced by them from childhood. 
1. japanese people wear masks when they travel or come out.  Usually we see 60% wearing masks daily on normal days. Even they catch very little cold they wear masks. This was their culture which helped in stopping the spread and cuts the chain. 
Normally any public facing person like receptionist, govt officers, doctors, nurses,station masters, train staff,police, janitors, etc wear masks daily at work. During winter we make children to wear a mask Daily so that they dont bother others when they catch cold. At home we have kodomo mask box and normal mask box. Kodomo mask is for children which fits them properly. 
2. Japanese people lead a life where they dont bother others. They dont litter anything. They use dustbins only to litter or spit. Cleanliness is the part of their culture. They were taught how to be clean and public behaviour before learning alphabets in schools. 
3. They dont do handshake but bow to greet. 
4. Here washing hands is a part of culture. We have soaps and sanitizers in public toilets , office entrances and usually in every public space. Using sanitizers is pretty common which prevented spread of virus. I never used the sanitizers but from past 2 months am following the usage of sanitizers before entering office, using an elevator, the moment i see sanitizer try using it.  
5. In restrooms i noticed that people wash their hands and also clean and wipe the sink area too to make it comfortable for the next person to use it. This is a usual practice in public metro stations too. 
6. They carry wet tissue packets to clean their hands occasionally when they go out. 
7. They usually maintain social distance with all

This helped Japan to prevent lockdown. This needs a lot of Sadhana. These rules were part of Japanese culture which they practice with perfection. Something to learn from Japan.

3/29/20, 11:45 PM - Nagendra: *Recommedations from Psychologists*. 

1. Isolate yourself from news about the virus. (Everything we need to know, we already know).

2. Don't look out for death toll. It's not a cricket match to know the latest score. Avoid that.

3. Don't look for additional information on the Internet, it would weaken your mental state. 

4.Avoid sending fatalistic messages. Some people don't have the same mental strength as you (Instead of helping, you could activate pathologies such as depression).

5. If possible, listen to music at home at a pleasant volume. Join Book Clubs, Public Speaking Groups, Life Skills Workshop and learn to have Growth Mindset.

6. Maintain discipline in the home by washing your hands, putting up a sign or alarm for everyone in the house.

7. Your positive mood will help protect your immune system, while negative thoughts have been shown to depress your immune system and make it weak against viruses.

8. Most importantly, firmly believe that this *too shall also pass* and we will be safe...!

3/30/20, 5:38 PM - Vishak: Some piece of good news just filtering in on COVID 19. Reproducing a tweet from an Indian scientist that says it all: Prof. Anand Ranganathan, JNU tweets this research published by Indian researchers at ICGEB yesterday. I have downloaded the paper and read the findings. As per the conclusions mentioned by researchers, Indians have a unique microRNA namely hsa-miR - 27b which successfully mutates this virus nCoV-2. This perhaps reduces the lethality of the virus in Indians. In other words, the immunity in Indians becomes comparatively higher to fight against this particular virus. Great work by Indian scientists...

4/1/20, 8:03 PM - Anni jss: Dr Kamat's DED hypothesis on COVID 19

Why our Dirtiness Will Save Us from COVID-19?
Kamat's hypothesis on INDIAN SUBCONTINENTAL DIRTINESS EXPOSURE DIVIDEND (DED) FLATTENING THE CURVE 
(All copyrights reserved, 2020) 

Dr. Nandkumar Kamat
(M.Sc. Biochemistry, PhD Microbiology) 

An argument , hypothesis and prediction based on ecological, sociomedical, epigenomic, epigenetic and immunological grounds 

1. INDIA AND INDIANS ARE GOING TO WIN THIS WAR BECAUSE FORTUNATELY DESPITE MAXIMUM EFFORTS BY GLOBAL BRANDS WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY CONVERTED OURSELVES TO SANITIZED AND HYGIENE FREAKY STERILE WESTERN LIFESTYLE
2. Except the beneficiaries of National immunization mission most of Indians above 40 years are exposed to acute and chronic immune system challenges from air, water, food, soil for decades
3. Dirtiness is part of Indian culture because in all our outdoor activities we never care about sanitized or sterile environment
4. Herd immunity develops automatically among Indian communities and huge congregations like Kumbh have shown the resilience of Indians assembling in huge numbers
5. Water of sacred Ganga river is teeming in viruses but millions take dip and come out unscathed 
6. The entire food production, harvesting, storage, supply chain ecposes Indians to tremendous pathogen load
7. Fermented foods are integral part of Indian culture this developing a totally different Indian guy microbiome 
8. Indians get exposed continuously to more viruses from childhood like riots viruses, common cold viruses, mosquito and other vector borne viruses and develop antibodies against hundreds of such strains as they grow up this continuously training the immune system to new threats from air or water or food
9. The Dirtiness EXPOSURE DIVIDEND of Indians is an asset for expression of the genes required to recognise novel viral antigens. Unfortunately such immune challenges are missing in highly urbanized urban societies like in Europe and USA which are obsessed with sanitized and sterile environment
10. The diverse tropical and subtropical ecological and environment conditions in Indian subcontinent makes it difficult for temperature and humidity sensitive respiratory viruses to produce mass morbidity in a genetically heterogeneous population divided in four distinct racial types 

So basically the attacking viruses need to really succeed to defeat immune systems of Indians acclimatized to numerous immunity challenges over decades. A differential analysis of present morbidity and mortality cases in India would reveal that those who are getting Infected have been used to work in sanitized environment or had other pre-existing complications with weakened immune systems. 
In short , INDIA CANT PHOTOSTATIC ALLY COPY THE SANITIZED LIFESTYLE OF THE WESTERNERS
EXPOSURE of the children to some dirt outdoor is good. 
I predict that in same way many poor countries in Africa and Latin America will survive due to DED 
AFRICA WILL SHOW TREMENDOUS RESISTANCE TO COVID19

So it's our unique microbiome, exposure to numerous diverse pathogens and viruses and our collective success to face immune challenges which woluld help us and even other SAARC countries to flatten the curve by end of APRIL

BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN WE MUST NOT TAKE STANDARD PRECAUTIONS and distribute COVID19. 

THE THREE WEEKS NATIONAL LOCK DOWN is test of our discipline and patience and if everyone falls in line the overall epidemiological factors will tremendously reduce the COVID19 burden. South Korea understood this very well. 
It was having DED till 1965 and later it imitated USA in building an industrial society 
But their East Asiatic genome is equally resilient. 
South East Asian nations have nothing to worry due to DED. 

THE FOLLOWING Benchmarks are set here to test my DED hypothesis as of today Marc 30,2020. Check them yourself on April 14 and then recommend me for a Nobel prize. 
1. If DED has already started working then India won't see even 5000 cases till April 2-5, 2020
2. If DED works then India WOULD NOT HAVE even ,10000 cases till April 14, 2020 which is a very negligible number
3. If India reports less than 1000 deaths by April 14 , 2020 it's total proof that the curve was not flattened only due to lockdown but DED 
4. INDIA CAN BE DECLARED COVID19 only if the rate of new cases and deaths fall after April 14, 2020

I am confident that INDIA will win this war against the invisible enemy due to our DED 
as we watch total mayhem in so called Advanced and Developed countries with best health infrastructure. 

Let us all believe in our childhood. Our time spent outdoors. The way we experienced monsoons. 
It's time for ALL OF US TO INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY BOOST OUR IMMUNE SYSTEMS BY POSITIVE BIOFEEDBACK
THATS IS CONTINUE TO TELL YOURSELF
WE ARE INDIANS
WE ARE A CIVILIZATION
WE ARE DIVERSE
WE ARE RESILIENT
WE HAVE FACED STIFFER CHALLENGES
WE WOULD DEFEAT COVID 19
WE WOULD SURVIVE
WE WOULD WIN
WE WOULD RECOVER
WE WOULD WORK HARD TO RECOUP LOSSES
WE WOULD REBUILD THIS GREAT COUNTRY
WE WOULD NOT PERMIT ANY SUCH CHALLENGE IN FUTURE 
WE LOVE INDIA AND
THERE IS
NOTHING GREATER THAN THIS COUNTRY

4/2/20, 11:03 AM - Nagendra: 💦 After the 93 year old man in Italy got better in the hospital, he was told to pay for the ventilator for one day, and the old man cried. The doctor advised him not to cry over the bill.

What the old man said made all the doctors cry.

Old man said, "I don't cry because of the money I have to pay. I can pay all the money." *I cry because I have been breathing God's air for 93 years, but I never pay for it. It takes €5,000 to use a ventilator in a hospital for one day. Do you know how much I owe God ? I didn't thank God for that before."*

The truth of the news can't be verified, but the old man's words are worth our reflection.

When we breathe the air freely without pain or illness, no one takes the air seriously. Only when we enter the hospital can we know that even breathing oxygen with a ventilator costs money!

🙏🏽 *Cherish the time when we can breathe freely..!* 💐👏🏽
4/2/20, 11:03 AM - Nagendra: Nothing here is ours

4/3/20, 6:58 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Muslims called Abdul Kalam as Kafir, that's why they did throw stones on Muslim docs too, there nothing good about religiously blind people
4/3/20, 7:00 PM - Nagendra: Please put ur cum and give apple to muslim..
4/3/20, 7:03 PM - Theja: The root cause is Chinese actually. It's getting deviated to sabru. My POV is 69 . can't generalize. There are few good. Religion is man made. The content of character defines. Not hereditary. I end my debade.
4/3/20, 7:06 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: In India everything was good, untill they listened to Allah than indian constitution, religious man made adre, they can alter the religion for the sake of man, it should be generalized, because those people are sick bastards, it is thier character.
4/3/20, 7:09 PM - Theja: If we were united and if our religion was best. How they invaded and captured.
4/3/20, 7:13 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Arabians started trading horse for spices, thier greed to convert india into Islam started the invasion.

India was never ready for invasion because we never invaded anyone till date, we were at peace on our own, so it made easy for them
4/3/20, 7:15 PM - Nagendra: Adella bidappa show one hindu trying to spread corona..

4/3/20, 7:19 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: That they should understand, instead why they support Osama? Why the cheer when Pakistan arrested Abhinandan ?
4/3/20, 7:19 PM - Lola Infosys: 80% of Indian Muslims , their parents n grand parents were raped n forcefully converted during Mughal rule. Real invaded muslims from arab are very less

4/3/20, 7:26 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: See, Soudi sabi is different, indian sabi is different, like that Indian Buddhist is different, Chinese buddist is different
4/3/20, 7:27 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: In Soudi sabi, you have 2 castes, in indian sabis you can find many castes
4/3/20, 7:27 PM - Nagendra: China didnt tell to purposefully spread na .. we as Indians should understand we shouldn't use it as weapon
4/3/20, 7:27 PM - Lola Infosys: https://twitter.com/NEWS9TWEETS/status/1246035686077038592?s=19

4/3/20, 7:28 PM - Theja: World knows the truth. If you want to bring religion. I think xi is Taoism
4/3/20, 7:28 PM - Lola Infosys: They don't want to follow country law. They want only allah. 

Difference with other religion like buddism jains Hindus  etc, they obey land law. They change religion based on land law too

4/3/20, 7:53 PM - Lola Infosys: Did you say same when semen Sagarika generalized all hindus  when she tasted semen and said it's by a Hindu guy, anyway it turned out to be fake??
4/3/20, 7:53 PM - Nagendra: Isnt it stupidity of a muslim group to throw stones on doctors.. don't they have some sense .. what if the doctor was muslim ? Would they throw stones ?
4/3/20, 7:53 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: If you see my status, I have put that muslim doctor pic, so I didn't generalise, you should differentiate these people vs good people
4/3/20, 7:54 PM - Lola Infosys: Earlier in caa protest also they were asking religion and then allowing journalists n beating others
4/3/20, 7:56 PM - Theja: Yes they are throwing on Muslim doctor as well see arun status
4/3/20, 7:57 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Because they think they are kafirs
4/3/20, 7:57 PM - Vishak: Like wise u can't blame the entire china for the outbreak

4/3/20, 7:57 PM - Nagendra: Correct panda
4/3/20, 7:57 PM - Lola Infosys: They threw coz they didn't know she was moslem. Later they would have talked to her.

4/10/20, 10:34 AM - Vishak: Experts are predicting huge down fall of Economy due to the Corona .
I do not know much about these experts.
But I know for sure that they do not know anything about the value of human motivation and determined efforts.

If experts were to be believed, after the total destruction in 2nd World War Japan had NO future. BUT  the same Japan in just 3 decades or so, made US cry at the market place.

If the experts were to be believed, Israel should have been wiped out from the world map by the Arabs, but the fact is different.

As per the rules of Aerodynamics, the Bumble Bee can NOT fly. But it flies, because it does not know the rules of Aerodynamics.

If the experts were to be believed, we should have been no where in 83 Cricket World Cup.

If the experts were to be believed Wilma Rudolf, the first American lady to win 4 Olympic Gold in Athletics ,  should not have been in a position to walk without braces, no question of running.

If the experts were to be believed Arunima Sinha can hardly lead a normal life. But she climbed the Mount Everest.

The corona crisis is no different. I do not have any doubt that,  We will defeat the Corona hands down  and The Indian Economy will bounce back in a great manner. 

Ratan Tata
