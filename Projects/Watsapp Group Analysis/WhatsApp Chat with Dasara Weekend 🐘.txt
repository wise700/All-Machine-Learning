ಸಿಕ್ಕಿದವರಿಗೆ ಆಗಲಿ ಒಂದು ಪ್ರಾಪ್ತಿ

ಜನ್ಮಾಷ್ಟಮಿ - ಬೆಣ್ಣೆ, ತುಪ್ಪ ತಿನ್ನೋದು ನಿಲ್ಸಿ ಅದೇ ದುಡ್ಡು ದಾನ ಮಾಡಿ

Xmas n New Yr - ಕುಡಿದು, ರೋಡ್ ನ ಬ್ಲಾಕ್ ಮಾಡಿ, ಜನರ ಜೊತೆ ಕೆಟ್ಟ ಮಾತಾಡಿ, ಮಜಾ ಮಾಡ್ರೋ.  ನಮ್ದೆ ದುನಿಯಾ

Modiji : Don't talk like a fool.

RaGa : My question is simple what did you have for lunch yesterday night.

Modiji : Listen dear Raga yesterday night i had khichdi with 3 chapatis and a little chaas with 1 apple and it was 11pm in the night and that is called dinner & not lunch.

RaGa : Don't give me such long reply to a simple question asked 
WHAT lunch DID YOU HAVE TONIGHT ?

Modiji: 🙄 ??

RaGa : Since you are not able to answer a simple question raised , its very clear that there is something fishy about the lunch you had yesterday night. I demand a independent committee to further investigate this very serious matter.

ವಿದ್ಯುತ್ತನ್ನು ಕಂಡುಹಿಡಿದಿದ್ದು ಬೆಂಜಮಿನ್ ಪ್ರ್ಯಾಂಕ್ಲಿನ್ಎಂದು ಹೇಳುತ್ತೇವೆ….

ಇದೇ ಬೆಂಜಮಿನ್ ತಾವು ಬರೆದ ಒಂದು ಪುಸ್ತಕದಲ್ಲಿ  ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾರೆ.. 

“ಒಂದು ರಾತ್ರಿ ನಾನು ಭಾರತದ ಪ್ರಾಚೀನವಾದ ಒಂದು ಗ್ರಂಥವನ್ನು ಓದಿದೆ. ಅದರಲ್ಲಿನ ಒಂದು ವಾಕ್ಯ ರಾತ್ರಿಯಿಡೀ ನನ್ನನ್ನು ಕಾಡುತ್ತಿತ್ತು. ಯೋಚಿಸಿ ಯೋಚಿಸಿ ಆ ವಾಕ್ಯದ ಅರ್ಥವನ್ನು ಗ್ರಹಿಸಿದೆ. ಅದು ನನಗೆ ವಿದ್ಯುತ್ತನ್ನು ಕಂಡು ಹಿಡಿಯಲು ನೆರವಾಯಿತು“

ಹಾಗಾದರೆ ಆ ವಾಕ್ಯ ಯಾವುದು…?

ಅದು ಅಗಸ್ತ್ಯಮುನಿಗಳು ಬರೆದ “ಅಗಸ್ತ್ಯ ಸಂಹಿತೆ” ಯಲ್ಲಿನ ಒಂದು ವಾಕ್ಯವಾಗಿತ್ತು…!!!

ಮಹರ್ಷಿ ಅಗಸ್ತ್ಯರು, ಮಹಾರಾಜ ದಶರಥನ ರಾಜಗುರುವಾಗಿದ್ದರು. ಸಪ್ತರ್ಷಿಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಒಬ್ಬರಾಗಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಅವರು “ಅಗಸ್ತ್ಯ ಸಂಹಿತಾ” ಎಂಬ ಗ್ರಂಥವನ್ನು ಬರೆದಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಆಶ್ಚರ್ಯಕರ ಸಂಗತಿಯೇನೆಂದರೆ ಅಗಸ್ತ್ಯ ಸಂಹಿತೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ವಿದ್ಯುತ್ ಉತ್ಪಾದನೆಗೆ ಸಂಬಂಧಿಸಿದ ಅನೇಕ ವಿಷಯಗಳಿವೆ…!!

ಈ ಶ್ಲೋಕಗಳನ್ನು ನೋಡಿ…

ಸಂಸ್ಥಾಪ್ಯ ಮೃಣ್ಮಯೇ ಪಾತ್ರೇ
ತಾಮ್ರಪತ್ರಂ ಸುಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಮ್ ।
ಛಾದಯೇಚ್ಛಿಖಿಗ್ರೀವೇಣ
ಚಾರ್ದಾಭಿಃ ಕಾಷ್ಠಪಾಂಸುಭಿಃ ॥
ದಸ್ತಾಲೋಷ್ಟೋ ನಿಧಾತ್ವಯಃ ಪಾರದಾಛಾದಿತಸ್ತತಃ ।
ಸಂಯೋಗಾಜ್ಜಾಯತೇ ತೇಜೋ
ಮಿತ್ರಾವರುಣ ಸಂಜ್ಞಿತಮ್ ॥

ಈ ಶ್ಲೋಕದ ಕಂಗ್ಲೀಷಾಣುವಾದ ಹೀಗಿದೆ

ಒಂದು ಮಣ್ಣಿನ ಪಾತ್ರೆಯನ್ನು ತೆಗೆದುಕೊಳ್ಳಿ ; ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ತಾಮ್ರದ ಪಟ್ಟಿಯನ್ನು ಹಾಕಿ ; ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ Copper sulphate ಹಾಕಿ, ಅನಂತರ ಮಧ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ Wet saw dust ನ್ನು ಹಾಕಿ ; ಮೇಲಿನ ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ Mercury ಹಾಗೂ Zink ನ್ನು ಉಪಯೋಗಿಸಿ. ಆಮೇಲೆ ತಂತಿಗಳನ್ನು ಸೇರಿಸಿ. ಆಗ ಮಿತ್ರಾವರುಣಶಕ್ತಿಯ (ವಿದ್ಯುತ್) ಉತ್ಪಾದನೆಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ..

ಬೆಂಜಮಿನ್ ವಿದ್ಯುತ್ ಕಂಡುಹಿಡಿಯಲು ಇಷ್ಟು Clue ಸಾಕಲ್ವಾ ಮಿತ್ರರೇ…?

ಇಷ್ಟೇ ಅಲ್ಲ. ಅಗಸ್ತ್ಯ ಸಂಹಿತೆಯಲ್ಲಿ Electroplatingನ ವಿವರಣೆ ಕೂಡ ಸಿಗುತ್ತದೆ…

22/01/2019, 9:38 pm - Lola Infosys: During tea break in office today, my Korean colleague asked me "Please tell me who is Shivakumara Swami, why are millions of people in such deep grief over his demise?"

I asked him "Do you know Mother Teresa?"

He replied "Of course, world renowned Nobel Prize winner popular for her humanitarian works. We even had a paragraph about her in our textbooks"

I said "Very good. Now think about Mother Teresa, her accomplishments & her ecosystem, subtract religious conversions from it, subtract media publicity from it, add 132 educational institutions producing 50,000 graduates annually to strengthen Indian economy, add Gurukuls educating 10,000 students annually to safeguard traditional academic learning, add free meals facility to all students, add agricultural initiatives supporting 5 lakh farmers annually, and that's how you finally get Shivakumara Swamiji"

He exclaimed "Wow!! This is seriously unbelievable. He seems to be a role model for humanitarian efforts for the whole world. In South Korea, we knew about Indians like Mother Teresa & Mahatma Gandhi, but I wonder why we were never aware of Shivakumara Swamiji"

I said "There's a simple reason for it. The global media never tried to highlight his efforts & achievements, because he always wore saffron".

01/02/2019, 2:40 pm - Anni jss: <Media omitted>
01/02/2019, 2:55 pm - Anni jss: But I think due to increase to 5lk taxable income for people above 5lk will reduce..
01/02/2019, 2:57 pm - Anni jss: Like, if some is getting 15lk per annum now, he will come into 20% tax bracket. Since they increased it to 5lk, his taxable income will become less or equal to 10lk. Which means that person now will come under 10% tax bracket. So the same guy now will pay half the tax he is currently paying
01/02/2019, 3:01 pm - Nagendra: U r right
01/02/2019, 3:01 pm - Anni jss: 😁👍🏼

3. Cheap loans
4. Fasal bima
5. 1.5 times MSP
6. Interest Subvention
7. Capital subsidy

11/02/2019, 12:32 pm - Lola Infosys: The younger brother defaulted loan & sold company to elder brother to repay loan. 

The elder brother took loan from same bank to take over the younger brother's company. 

Now the bank got reduced NPA with stronger loan book. Nothing came or gone despite everything got good. 

Company Share prices got doubled in a week.
Mukesh allowed Anil to announce bad news and drop the share prices. The public sold off and Mukesh bought the shares (through loan) at dead cheap prices. Now prices are high. He pays off the loan to the bank by transferring it shares or with partners/partial sell in public. He has a company at zero cost.

*That's Ambani Brothers for you*

ಎಲ್ಲಿಯವರೆಗೂ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ಸಿನ ಒಬ್ಬ  ಪ್ರಧಾನಮಂತ್ರಿ ಜೀವಂತವಿರುತ್ತಾನೋ ಅಲ್ಲಿಯವರೆಗೂ ಮತ್ತೊಬ್ಬ ಪ್ರಧಾನ ಮಂತ್ರಿ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ಸಿನಿಂದ ಆಯ್ಕೆಯಾಗಿ ಬರಲ್ಲ.

ಉದಾಹರಣೆ:-....
ನೆಹರು ತೀರಿಕೊಂಡ ನಂತರ ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿ ಪ್ರಧಾನಮಂತ್ರಿಯಾದರು, ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿ ತೀರಿಕೊಂಡ ನಂತರ ಇಂದಿರಾ ಗಾಂಧಿ ಪ್ರಧಾನಮಂತ್ರಿ ಆದ್ರು, 
ಇಂದಿರಾ ಗಾಂಧಿ ತೀರಿಕೊಂಡ ನಂತರನೆ ರಾಜೀವ ಗಾಂಧಿ ಆದ್ರು, ರಾಜೀವ್ ಗಾಂಧಿ ಸತ್ತ ನಂತರ  ಪಿ ವಿ ನರಸಿಂಹರಾವ್ ಪ್ರಧಾನ ಮಂತ್ರಿ ಆದ್ರು,  
ಆಮೇಲೆ ಎಲ್ಲಿಯವರೆಗೂ ಪಿ ವಿ ನರಸಿಂಹ ರಾವ್ ಸಾಯಲಿಲ್ಲವೋ ಅಲ್ಲಿಗಂಟ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಅಧಿಕಾರದಿಂದ ಹೊರಗಿತ್ತು ಮತ್ತು ಯಾವೊಬ್ಬ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ಸಿಗನೂ ಪ್ರಧಾನಿ ಆಗಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಯಾವಾಗ 2004ರಲ್ಲಿ ಪಿ ವಿ ನರಸಿಂಹ ರಾವ್ ನಿಧಾನರಾದರೊ ಆ ವರ್ಷವೇ ಮನಮೋಹನ್ ಸಿಂಗ್ ಪ್ರಧಾನಿಯಾದ್ರು🙄.

ಮ್ಯಾಟರ್ ಇಷ್ಟೇ ...ಎಲ್ಲಿಗಂಟ ಮನಮೋಹನ್ ಸಿಂಗ್ ಜೀವಂತವಾಗಿ ಇರ್ತಾರೋ ಅಲ್ಲಿಗಂಟ ಪಪ್ಪು ಅಷ್ಟೇ ಅಲ್ಲ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ಸಿನ ಯಾರೊಬ್ಬರೂ ಸಹ ಪ್ರಧಾನಮಂತ್ರಿ ಆಗಲ್ಲ.

ಆ ದೇವರು ಮನಮೋಹನ್ ಸಿಂಗ್ ಅವರಿಗೆ ಆಯುರಾರೋಗ್ಯ ಕೊಟ್ಟು ನೂರು ಕಾಲ ಸುಖವಾಗಿರಲಿ ಎಂದು ಬೇಡಿಕೊಳ್ತಿನಿ🙏😜

13/02/2019, 3:34 pm - Anni jss: Tweets on Twitter by Dr. Gaurav Pradhan, a genius in politics:  Worth sharing, with every Indian.

1 Many of you react and ask why @narendramodi not sending 10 JANPATH gang to Jail. Let me give you a small example if u have listening ears and strategically thinking mind.

2 Why did Indra Gandhi make a comeback? Charan Singh arrested her and she made an event out of it by sitting on Road. That Picture was on every front page and Indian Women cried for a Widow Indira Gandhi and the whole Game was changed.

3. You must have witnessed Sonia and Rahul going to Patiala house court for bail on National Herald case. Do you know on that day entire central Delhi was choked by congress ppl? Even it spilled over to Noida, Faridabad, Gurugram? Imagine if she is jailed? Congress Crooks will burn India.

4. Congress came back in power bcoz Indians are a bunch of emotional people. Modi doesn't want to repeat Charan Singh mistake bcoz he is here for a long game. He will finish his opposition without a bullet fired and he is master in it. He finished Congress in Gujarat.

5 What does he need from us? SUPPORT and Patience. Question is, Will u give him support so that he can take a bold step or u prefer drinking cheap petrol?

6. So when Subramanian Swamy Sir shouts about sending 10 JANPATH gang to jail, I get confused. Either he doesn't understand history or he is helping 10JP gang to revive.

7 . Just think what a THIEF does? Think from his mind. First he plans to rob. Then he carefully plans his escape route. Then he tests this route few times. Finally he robs the place. In 10 Years, the first 5 years Italian gang planned a robbery by creating a massive global network.

8 . This global network includes Indian and international journalists & media houses, Cartels like russian, American, Arabs. They made deals with arms brokers and all other powerful people.
Including Judiciary and Babus. Now if u touch them even remotely, The whole network gets activated and this network will ensure INDIA is derailed and burnt . Narendramodi is a good student. He learned these tricks while he was Gujarat CM for 14 years.

10. So now Modi is very careful. He ensured that when he walked, he didn't step on any landmine laid by Italian Gang. So he focused on people's development. One step at a time. He doesn't work against the law or tradition. He built global reputation to discredit overseas cartel.

11 On media, he didn't touch even a single Journo but using SM and directly communicating with people, he demolished the Kingdom set up by Intellectuals and Journos. Slowly he destroyed Media credibility

12 . He finished Arms broker cartel by govt to govt deals. This helped 100% transparency and clean deals. While Italian used international Cartel network, Modi used people's trust to demolish Italian Cartel.

13. By building International trust with NRIs and other govts, he sends a message that we are here for mutual growth. This way he turned around many govts who were against him. Example is UAE, Saudi, US, Australia, Russia etc

14. Last but not the least, He put Italian Mafia on deathbed where they are neither alive nor dead. Entire Italian network is now on slow death and LS2019 will finish them.

15. Hope you remember my big tree analogy "When the tree is too big, poison the roots and kill it bcoz if u cut the tree, the branches and trunk will fall on small plants (people of India) and will crush a large eco system".

16 This is why my trust on narendra modiji is not shakeable, no matter what the situation is bcoz one thing I know loud and clear. He is here for INDIA and not for personal wealth. The reason for me to vote him as long as he runs for PMship

17 Chamchagiri is not in my blood. My father taught me this trick. hence my only suggestion to you is, have faith in Narendra modiji and don't let negativity seep into you. Even for a moment If u are upset, take a break for few days.

14/02/2019, 3:38 pm - Lola Infosys: ವ್ಯಾಲೆಂಟೇನ್ ಡೆ'ಗೆ ಇನ್ನೂ ಏಳು ದಿನ ಬಾಕಿ ಇತ್ತು.
ವಕೀಲ ಸಾಹೇಬರು ಒಂದು ಗಿಪ್ಟ್ ಸೆಂಟರ್ ಒಳಗೆ ಹೊಕ್ಕರು.
ಅಲ್ಲಿ ಸುಂದರವಾದ 40 ಕಾರ್ಡಗಳನ್ನು ಖರೀದಿಸಿದ ಅವರು ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ಕಳುಹಿಸ ಬೇಕಾದ ಜಾಗದ ವಿಳಾಸವನ್ನು ಬರೆದರು -

"ಹಲೋ ಡಾರ್ಲಿಂಗ್ !! ಪರಿಚಯ ಆಯಿತು ತಾನೆ ?? ಇವತ್ತು ಸಂಜೆ ಬೇಟಿಯಾಗೋಣ, "ಐ ಲವ್ ಯೂ "!

ಅಂಗಡಿಯವ ಕೇಳಿದ :- ಇದು ವಿಷಯ ಎಂತ ??

ವಕೀಲರು ಹೇಳಿದರು :- ಹೋದ ವರ್ಷ ವ್ಯಾಲೆಂಟೇನ್ ಡೆ' ಯಲ್ಲಿ  ಆಸು ಪಾಸಿನ ಕಾಲೋನಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹೀಗೆ 20 ಕಾರ್ಡ್ ಕಳುಹಿಸಿದ್ದೆ.!  ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ದಿನದಲ್ಲೇ ನಾಲ್ಕು ಡೈವೋರ್ಸ ಕೇಸ್ ಸಿಕ್ಕೀತು !

ಈ ವರ್ಷ 40 ಕಾರ್ಡ್ ಕಳುಹಿಸುತಿದ್ದೇನೆ.!

ಬಿಜೆನೇಸ್'ಲ್ಲಿ ಎಲ್ಲವೂ ನಡೆಯುತ್ತದೆ.
ನನ್ನ ಅಮ್ಮ ಒಂದು ಮಾತು ಹೇಳುತಿದ್ದರು...
"ಯಾವ ವ್ಯಾಪರವು ಸಣ್ಣದಲ್ಲ ಮತ್ತು ವ್ಯಾಪರಕ್ಕಿಂತ ದೊಡ್ಡ ಧರ್ಮ ಯಾವುದೂ ಇಲ್ಲ"

ಅಂಗಡಿಯವ ಈಗ ಕೋಮದಲ್ಲಿದ್ದಾನೆ

ಭ್ರಷ್ಟಾಚಾರ ಇಲ್ಲ. ವಿವಿಧ ಇಲಾಖೆಗಳ ವೈಫಲ್ಯದ ಉದಾಹರಣೆಗಳು ಸಿಕ್ಕಿಲ್ಲ. ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನು ದೂರಲು ಇದ್ದ ಒಂದೇ ಒಂದು ಸಂಗತಿ 'ರಾಫೇಲ್' ಕೂಡ ಮೊನ್ನೆಯಷ್ಟೇ ಸಿಎಜಿ ವರದಿಯಿಂದ ಹೊಗೆ ಹಾಕಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಿದೆ. ಸದ್ಯಕ್ಕೆ ಇಟಾಲಿಯನ್ ಯುವರಾಜನ ಬೆಟಾಲಿಯನ್ ನಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಎಲ್ಲ ಕ್ಷಿಪಣಿಗಳೂ ಠುಸ್ ಠುಸ್ ಎಂದು ನೆಲಕ್ಕೆ ಬೀಳುತ್ತಿವೆ. ಆತನ ಬತ್ತಳಿಕೆ ಖಾಲಿ ಖಾಲಿ. ಕೊಟ್ಟಕೊನೆಗೆ ಪಾಪಿಸ್ಥಾನಕ್ಕೆ ಕುಮ್ಮಕ್ಕು ಕೊಟ್ಟು ಯೋಧರ ಮೇಲೆ ದಾಳಿಯನ್ನಾದರೂ ಮಾಡಿಸಿ ಆ ಮೂಲಕ ಮೋದಿ ವಿಫಲ ಎಂದು ಕೂಗಿ ಹೇಳಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಆ ಮೂಲಕ ಮೋದಿಯ ಮೇಲೆ ಜನರ ಆಕ್ರೋಶ ಮುಗಿಲು ಮುಟ್ಟುವಂತೆ ನೋಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಮುಂದಿನ ಎರಡು ತಿಂಗಳು ಆ ಹವಾ ಕಾಯ್ದುಕೊಂಡರೂ ಸಾಕು, ಮೋದಿಗೆ ಬೀಳುವ ಓಟಿನ ಪ್ರಮಾಣವನ್ನು ಅಷ್ಟರಮಟ್ಟಿಗೆ ತಗ್ಗಿಸಬಹುದು. ಅಷ್ಟರಮಟ್ಟಿಗೆ ತನ್ನ ಸೀಟು ಗಳಿಕೆಯನ್ನು ಹೆಚ್ಚಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳಬಹುದು. 30-40 ಪಕ್ಷಗಳ ಜೊತೆ ಸೇರಿ, ಅವರ ಒಂದು ಎರಡು ಮೂರು ಸೀಟುಗಳನ್ನೆಲ್ಲ ಗುಡಿಸಿ ಒಟ್ಟು ಹಾಕಿ ಹೇಗೋ ಬಹುಮತ ಸಂಪಾದಿಸಿ ಅಧಿಕಾರ ಹಿಡಿಯಬಹುದು. ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನು ಅಧಿಕಾರದಿಂದ ದೂರ ಇಡುವುದೇ ಏಕೈಕ ಉದ್ದೇಶವಾಗಿರುವ ಎಲ್ಲ ಕಳ್ಳ-ಖೂಳರೂ ಈ ಘನಂದಾರೀ ಕೆಲಸದಲ್ಲಿ ತನ್ನ ಕೈ ಹಿಡಿದೇ ಹಿಡಿಯುತ್ತಾರೆ ಎಂಬುದೇ ಯುವರಾಜನಿಗಿರುವ ಅಚಲ ನಂಬಿಕೆ.

ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ಸೂಕ್ಷ್ಮವಿದೆ. ಯಾಕೆ ಈಗಲೇ, ಚುನಾವಣೆಗೆ ಎರಡು ತಿಂಗಳಿರುವಾಗಲೇ ಈ ದೊಡ್ಡ ಪ್ರಮಾಣದ ಹತ್ಯಾಕಾಂಡ ನಡೆದಿದೆ? ಕಾರಣಗಳನ್ನು ಹೀಗೆ ಪಟ್ಟಿ ಮಾಡಬಹುದು..

(1) ಈ ಮೂಲಕ ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನು ಅಧೀರಗೊಳಿಸುವುದು. ಚುನಾವಣಾ ಪ್ರಚಾರದ ಮೇಲೆ ಕರಿಛಾಯೆ ಮುಸುಕುವಂತೆ ಮಾಡುವುದು. ಚುನಾವಣೆಯತ್ತ ಮೋದಿ ಕೊಡಬೇಕಿದ್ದ ಗಮನವನ್ನು ರಕ್ಷಣಾ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆಯ ಕಡೆ ಕೊಡುವಂತೆ ಮಾಡಿ ಅಷ್ಟರಮಟ್ಟಿಗೆ ಮೋದಿ ಎಂಗೇಜ್ಡ್ ಆಗಿರುವಂತೆ ನೋಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದು.

(2) ಮೋದಿ, ಮತ್ತೆ ಸರ್ಜಿಕಲ್ ಸ್ಟ್ರೈಕ್ ಮಾಡಲು ಅಥವಾ ಯುದ್ಧ ಘೋಷಿಸಲು ತಡ ಮಾಡಿದರೆ 'ಏನ್ರೀ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಚೌಕಿದಾರ ಏನ್ ಮಾಡ್ತಿದಾನೆ? 56 ಇಂಚಿನ ಎದೆ ಎಲ್ಲಿ ಹೋಯ್ತು?' ಎಂದೆಲ್ಲ ಕಿಚಾಯಿಸುವುದು. ಆ ಮೂಲಕ, ಮೋದಿ ಓರ್ವ ಅಸಮರ್ಥ ನಾಯಕ ಎಂದು ಜನಸಾಮಾನ್ಯರಲ್ಲಿ ಬಿಂಬಿಸಲು ಯತ್ನಿಸುವುದು.

(3) ಮೋದಿ ಒಂದು ವೇಳೆ ಮತ್ತೆ ಸರ್ಜಿಕಲ್ ಸ್ಟ್ರೈಕ್ ಮಾಡಲು ಹೋದರೆ ಅಂತಾರಾಷ್ಟ್ರೀಯ ಮಟ್ಟದಲ್ಲಿ ಮೋದಿಯವರ ಮೇಲೆ ಒತ್ತಡ ತರುವುದು. ಮೋದಿ ಓರ್ವ blood thirsty ನಾಯಕ ಎಂದು ಬಿಂಬಿಸುವುದು. ಭಯೋತ್ಪಾದನೆಯನ್ನು ತಡೆಯಲು ಅಸಮರ್ಥ ನಾಯಕ ಎಂದು ಜಗತ್ತಿಗೆ ಕೂಗಿ ಹೇಳುವುದು. ಮೋದಿಯ ಪ್ರಭಾವ ತಗ್ಗಿಸಲು ಪ್ರಯತ್ನಿಸುವುದು.

(4) ಮೋದಿಯೇನಾದರೂ ದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿ ತುರ್ತು ಪರಿಸ್ಥಿತಿ ಘೋಷಿಸಿ ಯುದ್ಧಕ್ಕೆ ಸನ್ನದ್ಧರಾದರೆ ಆಕಾಶವೇ ಕಳಚಿ ಬಿತ್ತು ಎಂದು ಹಾರಾಡುವುದು. ದೇಶವನ್ನು ಯುದ್ಧದ ಅಂಚಿಗೆ ತಂದು ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸಿದ ನಾಯಕ ಎಂದು ದೇಶಾದ್ಯಂತ ಭಯದ ವಾತಾವರಣ ನಿರ್ಮಿಸುವುದು. ಚೀನಾ ಮೂಲಕ ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನು ಕಟ್ಟಿಹಾಕುವ ಕೆಲಸ ಮಾಡುವುದು. 

ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ಗಮನಿಸಿ. ಯೋಧರ ಹತ್ಯೆಯಾಗಿ ಕೇವಲ ಮೂರ್ನಾಲ್ಕು ತಾಸುಗಳೂ ಆಗಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಅಷ್ಟರಲ್ಲೇ ದೇಶದ ಬುದ್ಧಿಜೀವಿಗಳೆಲ್ಲ ಒಂದೇ ಸಲಕ್ಕೆ ಅಖಾಡಾಕ್ಕೆ ಧುಮುಕಿ ಮೋದಿಗೆ ಬುದ್ಧಿವಾದ ಹೇಳಲು ನಿಂತುಬಿಟ್ಟಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಯೋಧರ ಸಾವಿಗೆ ಮರುಗುವ ನಾಟಕವಾಡುತ್ತ, ಸಿಕ್ಕಿದ್ದೇ ಚಾನ್ಸ್ ಎಂದು ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನು ಹಳಿಯಲು ಈ ಸಂದರ್ಭ ಬಳಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. 'ಭಯೋತ್ಪಾದಕರ ಜೊತೆ ಮಾತುಕತೆ, ಚರ್ಚೆ ಮೂಲಕ ಶಾಂತಿ ಸಂಧಾನ ನಡೆಸಬೇಕು' ಎಂದು ಸಾಕ್ಷಿಪ್ರಜ್ಞೆಗಳು ಟ್ವಿಟ್ಟರ್ ನಲ್ಲಿ ಕುಟ್ಟುತ್ತಿವೆ. ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಈಗಾಗಲೇ ತನ್ನ ಅಫಿಷಿಯಲ್ ಹೇಳಿಕೆಯನ್ನು ಬಿಡುಗಡೆಗೊಳಿಸಿದೆ. 'ಎಲ್ಲಿದೆ 56 ಇಂಚಿನ ಎದೆ? ಇದೇ ಏನು ನೀವು ದೇಶಕ್ಕೆ ಕೊಡುವ ಭದ್ರತೆ?' ಎಂದೆಲ್ಲ ಕಿಚಾಯಿಸಲು ನಿಂತಿದೆ ಈ 150 ವರ್ಷಗಳ ಇತಿಹಾಸವಿರುವ ಪಕ್ಷ. ಮೋದಿಯ ವಿರುದ್ಧ ನಿಂತಿರುವ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಸಣ್ಣ-ದೊಡ್ಡ ರಾಜಕೀಯ ಪಕ್ಷಗಳೂ ಈ ಹತ್ಯಾಕಾಂಡವನ್ನು ತಮ್ಮ ರಾಜಕೀಯ ಲಾಭಕ್ಕೆ ಬಳಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದು ಹೇಗೆ ಎಂದು ಲೆಕ್ಕ ಹಾಕುತ್ತಿವೆ. ಮೋದಿ ಅಸಮರ್ಥ, ನಮ್ಮ ರಕ್ಷಣಾ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆ ಸರಿಯಾಗಿಲ್ಲ, ಸರಿಯಾದ ಭದ್ರತಾ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆ ಇಲ್ಲ, ಇದು ಭದ್ರತಾ ವೈಫಲ್ಯ, ಕೇಂದ್ರ ಸರಕಾರದ ವೈಫಲ್ಯ, ಇಂಟೆಲಿಜೆನ್ಸ್ ಫೈಲ್ಯೂರ್ ಎಂದೆಲ್ಲ ತಮ್ಮ ಮೂಗಿನ ನೇರಕ್ಕೆ ವ್ಯಾಖ್ಯಾನ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಿವೆ. ಇನ್ನು ಮುಂದಿನ ನಾಲ್ಕೈದು ದಿನಗಳಲ್ಲಂತೂ ಇದು ತಾರಕಕ್ಕೆ ಮುಟ್ಟಲಿದೆ. ಇಷ್ಟು ದಿನ ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನು ಬೆಂಬಲಿಸುತ್ತ ಬಂದಿರುವ ಶ್ರೀ ಸಾಮಾನ್ಯನ ಮನಸಲ್ಲೂ ಮೋದಿಯ ಕುರಿತು ಒಂದು ಸಣ್ಣ ಅಸಮಾಧಾನ, ಸಂಶಯ ಹುಟ್ಟುವಂತೆ ಮಾಡಿದ್ದೇ ಆದರೆ ಅದೇ ಈ ಪಕ್ಷಗಳ ಸಾಧನೆ!

ಹಾಗಾದರೆ, ಈ ಹತ್ಯಾಕಾಂಡದ ಹಿಂದೆ ಇರುವವರು ಯಾರು? ಯೋಚಿಸಿ! ಈ ಹತ್ಯಾಕಾಂಡದ ಲಾಭ ಪಡೆಯಲು ಯಾವೆಲ್ಲ ರಣಹದ್ದುಗಳು ಕಾತರಿಸುತ್ತಿವೆ? ಯೋಚಿಸಿ! ಈ ಹತ್ಯಾಕಾಂಡವನ್ನು ನೆಪ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡು ಯಾರೆಲ್ಲ ಮೋದಿಯ ವಿರುದ್ಧ ಹರಿಹಾಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ? ಯೋಚಿಸಿ! ಈ ಹತ್ಯಾಕಾಂಡವನ್ನು ಯಾರೆಲ್ಲ ಗುಟ್ಟಾಗಿ ಸಂಭ್ರಮಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ? ಯೋಚಿಸಿ! ಈ ದೇಶವನ್ನು ಹರಿದು ಹಂಚಿ ತಿನ್ನಲು ಯಾವೆಲ್ಲ ನರಿ ನಾಯಿ ಹದ್ದು ಹಂದಿಗಳು ಬಾಯಿ ಬಾಯಿ ಬಿಟ್ಟು ಕಾಯುತ್ತಿವೆ? ಯೋಚಿಸಿ!

ಮೋದಿಯವರ ಪರಿಸ್ಥಿತಿ ನಮ್ಮನಿಮ್ಮಂತೆ ಸರಳವಾದುದಲ್ಲ. ಏಕಕಾಲಕ್ಕೆ ಅವರು ಪಾಪಿಸ್ಥಾನದ ಜೊತೆ, ಅತ್ತ ಚೀನಾದ ಜೊತೆ, ಮತ್ತೆ ರಷ್ಯದ ಜೊತೆ, ಅದರಾಚೆ ಅಮೆರಿಕವೆಂಬ ತಲೆಕೆಟ್ಟ ದೇಶದ ಜೊತೆ ಏಗಬೇಕಿದೆ. ಮಾತ್ರವಲ್ಲ, ದೇಶದೊಳಗೇ ಇದ್ದು ದೇಶದ ಬೊಡ್ಡೆಯನ್ನು ತೂತುಕೊರೆದು ಬೀಳಿಸುವ ಎಲ್ಲ ಒರಲೆಗಳೊಂದಿಗೂ ಹೆಣಗಬೇಕಿದೆ. ಕೇವಲ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್, ಕಮ್ಯುನಿಸ್ಟ್ ಪಕ್ಷಗಳು ಮಾತ್ರವಲ್ಲ... ದೇಶದ ಛಪ್ಪನ್ನಾರು ಸಣ್ಣ ದೊಡ್ಡ ಪಕ್ಷಗಳೆಲ್ಲವೂ ಮೋದಿಯ ಅವಸಾನವನ್ನು ಚಾತಕಪಕ್ಷಿಗಳಂತೆ ಎದುರು ನೋಡುತ್ತಿವೆ ಎಂಬುದನ್ನು ಮರೆಯುವಂತಿಲ್ಲ. ಜೊತೆಗೆ, ದೇಶದ ಮಾನ-ಸಮ್ಮಾನಗಳನ್ನು ಹರಾಜು ಹಾಕಲೆಂದೇ ಬುದ್ಧಿಜೀವಿ ಚಿಂತಕರ ಪಡೆ ಸದಾ ಸನ್ನದ್ಧ. ಇವೆಲ್ಲ ದುಷ್ಮನ್ನರ ಜೊತೆ ಏಕಕಾಲಕ್ಕೆ ಅಭಿಮನ್ಯುವಾಗಿ ಸೆಣಸಬೇಕಾದ ಅನಿವಾರ್ಯತೆ ಸದ್ಯದ ಪ್ರಧಾನಿಗಳದ್ದು.

ಈ ವಿಪತ್ಕಾಲದಲ್ಲಿ ನೀವು ನಿಲ್ಲಬೇಕಾದ್ದು ಮೋದಿಯ ಜೊತೆಗಾ, ಅವರ ವಿರೋಧಿಗಳ ಜೊತೆಗಾ, ಯೋಚಿಸಿ!

15/02/2019, 3:08 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: In 1968 anti congress wave started. The congress got an idea, i.e. caste and religion. They deliberately lied about other parties and calling them communal so that they shouldn't vote against
15/02/2019, 3:09 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Changed the names to Gandhi, because village people never know what congress means. All they knew was Gandhi party

Crpf attack was due to modi's  weakness.

Now Modi has the ability to handle it.
The next langoor sitting for PM position in Congress , I bet , can never be able to handle this.
So vote Modi, save India. As of now and next few years
15/02/2019, 5:27 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Congress had much time comparatively to what BJP had. Open minds will accept the failure of dynasty politics
15/02/2019, 5:27 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: People ask for jobs, was it required 70 years to build a train like Train 18

15/02/2019, 8:51 pm - Vishak: I am not one to rush into political shaming on Social media . It only divides opinions and never give conclusions. 

But then what happened is #phulwama opened the same set of questions we always ask and then keep them back in the locker until next time.

1. There were 2547( as reported) Jawans and soldiers that were transported in two convoys in 78 Buses. Now when we all know the sensitivity and how the scenarios are in the valley. Cant we airlift our soldiers and make them reach safely. I mean not too big too ask. For a moment just think of what could have been . that is too many lives to gamble on. 

But why the question of Airlifting- Coz each Minister, MOS, Administrator, Left wing, right wing, media intellectual who would visit the valley, condemn the attack , chest and fist pump would be airlifted to the place.  Now who deserves it more is the question.

2. The media like Dogs and vultures would report every single thing for the next 10-15 days . The moment in valley, the meetings of officials, the army camps. Even their family members info would be revealed on television.

What For - To make a ready made intelligence report and submit for further events like #phulwama to the enemy. I am sure we can have sensibilities to differentiate between National security and the need to fill up your corporate Lockers.

3. A soldier's duty is to stand for the security of his mother land first, His fellow countrymen next and then the political brass who jumps to take the credit away.

But were-The soldier were never  meant to be martyred for our intelligence failings, own diplomatic priorities or to settle agendas.  

4. Masood Azhar should have been taken to the UN Council and should have been banned and necessary bans should have been put.

But what's the point- This wasn't done because CHINA didn't wanted it to be done. And we played soft belly to keep our diplomatic scores settled .  

The point is do we need the loss of 44 men to let us know the harsh truth of how we fail them each single time and put a condolence message.  

Until them #RIP . We failed you yet again. You deserved better.

16/02/2019, 10:31 pm - Vishak: 👆🏻 it shows war is won with brains not muscle
16/02/2019, 10:41 pm - Anni jss: See, if we go to war now itself, we might be little rusty, ill prepared, can do mistakes which might cost many more lives.. first make them economically weak, meanwhile prepare a plan, then attack..

16/02/2019, 10:46 pm - Anni jss: Else China is also anti muslim.. read the recent impositions on Muslims in China.. no loud speaker, no burqua and many more things
16/02/2019, 10:46 pm - Anni jss: India is China's largest goods consumer, if India stops Chinese products, their business will take a hit

16/02/2019, 10:56 pm - Anni jss: But good thing is, India stands United irrespective of religions when army is attacked
16/02/2019, 10:57 pm - Vishak: Ya we must

18/02/2019, 8:52 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: FACTS ABOUT KASHMIR TERRORISM.

👁 👁    EYE  OPENER   👁 👁

State of J&K Under India ( Area wise 101380 sq Km) Excluding POK.

Kashmir  :  15%
Jammu   :  26%
Ladakh    :  59%

85,000 sq Km comprising 85% area are not Muslim Majority.

Population  - 1.25 Crores

Kashmir :  69 Lakhs. (Only 55 Lakhs speak Kashmiri. Rest 13 lakhs speak Non kashmiri languages.)

Jammu : 53 Lakhs.
(Dogri, Punjabi, Hindi)
 
Ladakh :  03 Lakhs. (Ladakhi language)

This does not include 7.5 lakh people settled who do not have citizenship.

There are 22 districts in J&K. Out of which only 5 Districts where separatists have the say ; 
Srinagar, Anantnag, Baramullah, Kulgam and Pulwama.  

Other 17 districts are Pro India.  
So separatist's writ runs in just 15% of the population which are Sunni Muslim dominated. 

Interestingly these 5 districts are far away from Pakistan Border/LOC.

There are more than fourteen major Religious/ ethinic groups comprising 85% of the population of J&K who are Pro India.

These include:

Shias ; 

Dogras: (Rajputs, Brahmins & Mahajans);

Kashmiri Pandits;

Sikhs; 

Buddhists ( Ladakhis ); 

Gujjars;

Bakarwals; 

Paharis; 

Baltis;

Christians & many more.

Majority of the people in J&K do not speak Kashmiri as their mother tongue. It's Dogri, Gujjari, Punjabi, Ladhaki , Pahari etc.

Only 33 % people in Kashmir speak Kashmiri & this group controls narrative from Hurriyat to militants and from NC and PDP.

This 33% controls business, bureaucracy & agriculture. This sunni 33% is opposed to India although population of all other muslims in JK is 69 %.

Shias (12%), Gujjars Muslims (14%), Pahadi Muslims ( 8%), Buddhists , Pandits, Sufis, Christians and Jammu Hindus/ Dogras ( aprox 45%) are totally opposed to separatism and Pakistan.

Stone pelting , Hoisting of Pakistani flags & Anti India demonstrations are held in just 5 Districts in Kashmir valley.

Other 17 districts have never participated in such activities.

Poonch and Kargil have above 90% Muslim population. There has never been an Anti India or separatist protest in these districts.

It is only the Anti National Media and other Anti India forces who with their own nefarious designs have created an impression that "WHOLE J&K" is against India.

Whereas the truth is that  just 15% of the Population comprising Sunni Muslims inhabiting 5 Districts of Kashmir province are fanning the separatist activities.

Please spread this message to every INDIAN to UNITE and SAVE the Sovereignty of Our Nation and Defeat the Nefarious Designs of Pakistan and root out terrorism.

Jai Hind

Thanx to Prakash Katoch for the fabulous post

ಯಾರೋ ಹೇಳಿದರು ಬಿಯರ್ ಕುಡಿ. ಸ್ಟೋನ್ ಹೋಗುತ್ತದೆ ಎಂದು.

  ಸ್ಟೋನ್ ಹೋಗಿ ತುಂಬಾ ದಿನ ಆಗಿದೆ.

ಈಗ   ಕಿಡ್ನಿಯು ಹೋಗುವ ಹಂತದಲ್ಲಿದೆ.

If so , is it because of constant whining of feminists? Or is it because of actual talent? If it is because of talent, appreciate it, but I don't see why #girlpower is needed, coz #boypower was never a thing till now.

28/02/2019, 3:46 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Congratulations Pakistan succeeded
28/02/2019, 3:46 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: You guys think war is so easy ?
28/02/2019, 3:47 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Do you even know how nuclear bomb look like ? And where it will be placed
28/02/2019, 3:47 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: And, you don't know that few Indian cities have nuclear shield
28/02/2019, 3:48 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: And Pakistan lost 2 times with india, why didn't they launched nuclear 'in the verge of losing' ?
28/02/2019, 3:49 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: And moreover no one actually knows even both of our bomb work or not ?
28/02/2019, 3:50 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: If war happens, Pak will lose pok also, and China knows it and that's why they will not allow anyone to do war.
28/02/2019, 3:51 pm - Nagendra: Sari bidappa neene army major ninge gottu

You guys talk like Deepavali bomb gonna blast
28/02/2019, 4:06 pm - Anni jss: Pls show how it looks Arun. Ond sala nodbidona
28/02/2019, 4:08 pm - Anni jss: Naga or anybody is scared to nuclear bomb cos, no sane person in Pakistan as well launch it. If at all the keys for the nuclear bomb lands in the hands of a terrorist, they are fanatics, they have nothing to loose, they will launch it
28/02/2019, 4:08 pm - Lola Infosys: If we reclaim pok, then China is blocked by direct India n afgan borders. They can't do trade with middle East . So they will either support pak or stop war from happening
28/02/2019, 4:08 pm - Anni jss: Yes
28/02/2019, 4:11 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: No actual pic available anywhere. 

I heard it will be kept in submarine or far somewhere for safety purposes, these media will show like bomb is now in Imran Khan basement.
28/02/2019, 4:11 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: That's rarely going to happen, Afghan was once far more dangerous than Pakistan.

Look at them now.
28/02/2019, 4:12 pm - Anni jss: As per my common sense, all nuclear or any missiles won't be kept in one place...there will be multiple launch pads for every missle.
28/02/2019, 4:12 pm - Anni jss: Afghan was never a nuclear warhead country.. they were only having guns, some rocket launchers.. Pakistan is different
28/02/2019, 4:13 pm - Anni jss: I believe nuke is not in control of imran as well.. someone in their army or general will have the power to exercise it.. PM or president in Pak is dummy
28/02/2019, 4:13 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Even without nuclear weapons, they were far more Dangerous than any.
28/02/2019, 4:14 pm - Anni jss: That was cos they were good in guerrilla warfare.. guerrilla is dangerous when you are facing the enemy head on.. but nuke can be launched from the place where u are sitting
28/02/2019, 4:15 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: It's like Pak waited till modi to plant bomb.

Kargil war was the biggest defeat for Pak, avaglu terrosism ittu ivaglu ide.

Innen soltare and takshna nuclear hakbidtare annodella dubak
28/02/2019, 4:15 pm - Lola Infosys: As per Hollywood movies ,launch keys will be with 2 different ppl and they need to put it and press buttons together. Not just with pm. And launch pads will be far off, subs, hills, farms, unexpected places
28/02/2019, 4:16 pm - Anni jss: During Kargil, I think both India and Pakistan were not nuclear warheads.. it's only after Kargil, both became nuclear states
28/02/2019, 4:16 pm - Anni jss: Yeah..
28/02/2019, 4:17 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: If I were to encourage your statements, even if they trigger nuclear weapons, india has nuclear shields, ballistic programs.  Which will Destroy the missile at minimal loss
28/02/2019, 4:17 pm - Anni jss: It's not that soltaare anta gotaadaaga they will surely launch.. fanatics can do anything is the point.  Their mind is not stable.. that is what the case is
28/02/2019, 4:17 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Pak had, India also had. But both were tested it long back so no one was trusting one another
28/02/2019, 4:17 pm - Lola Infosys: Yes. Israel tech. That dome shield program which they bought. Automatically it will launch counter missiles n destroy in air
28/02/2019, 4:18 pm - Anni jss: Yeah that is their.. India has capability to destroy a missle mid air, but we shouldn't go to that extent
28/02/2019, 4:19 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: I'm still saying, it's not a child game.

We may not know what are all the equipment internally placed.

And what are all the international territories take precautions to avoid these kinds.

We won't be knowing any confidential things placed
28/02/2019, 4:20 pm - Anni jss: Totally agreed, but we shouldn't go to that extent
28/02/2019, 4:21 pm - Nagendra: <Media omitted>
28/02/2019, 4:21 pm - Anni jss: Saw this video last week
28/02/2019, 4:21 pm - Nagendra: Nuclear war today means end of world..
28/02/2019, 4:22 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: That's what I'm telling. This time war means end only , so even though war is between India and Pakistan, it will affect so many people
28/02/2019, 4:22 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: So strong countries like US Russia China are warning Pakistan
28/02/2019, 4:22 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Because 4th is India✌🏼
28/02/2019, 4:23 pm - Nagendra: U r the only one telling nothing happens to India.. all others r telling it will affect everyone..
28/02/2019, 4:23 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: The propaganda in media is slowly turning out anti modi
28/02/2019, 4:23 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: I expected it
28/02/2019, 4:23 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Who ? News channels ashte heltirodu
28/02/2019, 4:24 pm - Nagendra: I am talking about our group

28/02/2019, 4:24 pm - Nagendra: Forget news channel
28/02/2019, 4:24 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: I'm still telling, what will happen?
28/02/2019, 4:24 pm - Nagendra: We all feel if it's war its bad.. u r the only one telling as if nothing happens
28/02/2019, 4:24 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Pak army is 1/4 of Indian army
28/02/2019, 4:24 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: They lost 2 wars, 3rd one of they do this
28/02/2019, 4:25 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: They will lose POK which was given by congress to them
28/02/2019, 4:25 pm - Anni jss: Arun, conventional war, everyone knows India will win. It's the fickle mind of Pak which India is worried about
28/02/2019, 4:25 pm - Nagendra: U r blind leave it
28/02/2019, 4:26 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: For fickle minds it was easy to attack India before 2014 , not now.

Saama, daana, bedha, danda.


Pak is doing the third plan called Bedha, ashte
28/02/2019, 4:26 pm - Anni jss: But It doesn't mean, India should be worried and de-escalate.. India needs to be positive and attack them when time is right
28/02/2019, 4:27 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Our media wants news, if you guys have seen Kannada channels, they are provoking people to do war like anything
28/02/2019, 4:28 pm - Nagendra: U r simply connecting media Congress n all..
28/02/2019, 4:29 pm - Nagendra: Just think of two countries war and people
28/02/2019, 4:29 pm - Nagendra: Nobody here cares about media or Congress
28/02/2019, 4:29 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: I said 10% about congress, all I did was replying to all your messages
28/02/2019, 4:30 pm - Nagendra: Ur replies are more driven politically than normal
28/02/2019, 4:31 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: 1st of nuclear bomb hakbitre, they know they also won't be surviving, Pakistan or take any jihadis they don't have any meter.

28/02/2019, 4:38 pm - Nagendra: Ella selfish politicians always thinking power money power money
28/02/2019, 4:38 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: See, here we make mistakes.

We see the solders are strugglers, but they are enjoying their work in protecting us. They are ready to give like for motherland and it's their duty like how we secure our parents.

At the time of joining army only that person will be ready for anything.

28/02/2019, 4:40 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Who smiled now ?
28/02/2019, 4:40 pm - Nagendra: People have to learn to speak based on situation
28/02/2019, 4:40 pm - Nagendra: When everyone is worried about nation yeddie is worried about his seat

28/02/2019, 4:41 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: I'm not defending him, I only said, '22 seat win' he was telling from long back.

28/02/2019, 4:57 pm - Anni jss: Already it's time for him..
28/02/2019, 4:59 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Sometimes working hard won't give you success - Yeddy is the latest example.

He built BJP from ground, spent entire life to populate, but he won't be enjoying what he dreamt
28/02/2019, 5:02 pm - Lola Infosys: Media, both RW and LW connected politics to this strike. Can't say who first. Both have made. One starts means, others won't keep quiet. And it goes on n on. That's the reality. Finally if one side is making the good ones as wrong, other side definitely has to make comments. So twitter is full of this now.

02/03/2019, 10:50 pm - Anni jss: What has happened on Feb 27th (as per one of my IAF friend)..Minute by Minute details 
9:52 AM – Indian Netra and Northern Air command detected ten F16 took off from 3 Airbases from Pakistan. They came in 3 groups and merged in attack formation near POK. 
9:54: AM – India scrambled 2 Mig21 bisons and 4 Sukoi MKi to intercept 10 PAK F16 
9.58 AM – India sounded alert to PAF fighters that, you are about to encroach Indian air space. Please evade. 
9.59 AM – India sounded alert # 2  to PAF with IFAC protocols and they didn’t respond 
10:00 AM - PAF violates Indian airspace. With Swarm merge attack formation (which is tactical in nature) 
10:01 AM - Nine F16 forced to deviate path and within 1 KM of airspace they returned to POK side after heavy surface to air ground artillery and valiant fight from our Sukoi and Migs. 
10:02 AM -  One PAK F16 went deep inside Indian territory probably 3 KMs to destroy an Oil storage at an army brigade HQ 
10:03 AM – One IAF Sukoi and one Mig 21 Bison (Flt Lt Abhinandan Varthaman) continued engaging the F16 in a dog fight maneuver called “Defensive split”. Mig 21 was in the front, then F16 and then a sukoi. Due to firing from sukoi, F16 flee the scene using a dog fight maneuver called “wingover”. 
10:04 AM – Sukoi hovered around oil field guarding it and Mig 21 Bison (Wg Cdr Abhinandan) chased F16 out of Indian territory. While chasing he engaged F16 in a lock-in position for his onboard R-73 air to air missile to be deployed. 
Here you have to applaud the courage of Abhinandan. He could have returned to base. But if he returns to base then the missile lock in would have been disengaged (due to out of radar coverage) and he will not be able to shoot F16 down. So he decided to chase him down to POK and shoot him down. 
10:08 AM – He engaged his R73 missile that hit the F16 and drowned him 
10:08 AM – After shooting him down he performed a highly dangerous maneuver called “High-g barrel roll”. He had to do this because he had been in the vicinity of PAK surface to air artillery and SAM. While doing so he has to vertically climb at high speed and reverse its direction towards India. While doing so his old outdated Mig 21 bison’s engine thrust had a problem and he became almost non-maneuverable for few secs. And during that time either a SAM or air artillery hit his plane. 

So people should understand what has happened. Not upgrading or replacing the ageing jets and just upgrading radar and avionics doesn’t give you the edge. 
It requires a huge piloting skills, ability and courage to drown a F16 with a Mig21. 

So salute to Abhinandan

Opposition should be equally good and challenge ruling party with development n ideas. Here it is only lies. 

People should really think whom to vote since both do good. Now it's like development vs scams
11/03/2019, 10:23 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: Congress won't get majority, so they has to listen to all the dogs around, so no development
11/03/2019, 10:23 am - Vishak: Ya
11/03/2019, 10:24 am - Vishak: Actually any party with 50 seats would do the same they will feel helpless but that's where u show u r party with difference

11/03/2019, 1:18 pm - Lola Infosys: Caste based won't work. They don't deserve development . All the yojanas should be removed
11/03/2019, 1:19 pm - Vishak: Thing is it comes to wats in it for me

11/03/2019, 1:22 pm - Vishak: Theja for now given up on 120 seats to bjp
11/03/2019, 1:22 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: There is only one reason for BJP to lose i.e. Negative Propaganda of Media and Left wing
11/03/2019, 1:27 pm - Abhilash: As the poll suggests, people based on certain caste want him as PM.

Not people who need nation development
11/03/2019, 1:28 pm - Vishak: Ya
11/03/2019, 1:32 pm - Theja: Yeah but I have got people mindset rite
11/03/2019, 1:33 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: It's wrong, being educated we must educate them while we can to lead them right
11/03/2019, 1:34 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: To be frank, I'm spreading msg to as many people I can, explaining them about generic medicine, PMJay, train 18, Awas Yojana etc
11/03/2019, 1:36 pm - Abhilash: Yes, cos you are the ppl who need certain castes to have favoured over nation
11/03/2019, 1:39 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Just imagine if congress comes to power, so many terrorists attack inside country, and gaandus like RG won't retaliate also
11/03/2019, 1:50 pm - Lola Infosys: Actually this poll is fake. Majority of Muslims vote modi. Only pure arabic saabi anti hindu goat fuckers hate modi ashte
11/03/2019, 1:51 pm - Abhilash: Hmmm
11/03/2019, 1:52 pm - Theja: Equity for all 
Evident nation has progressed
11/03/2019, 1:52 pm - Lola Infosys: But yea that poll on Caste , can't say same. They have selfish needs. Not development
11/03/2019, 1:54 pm - Lola Infosys: Education, free food, ration, jobs . So much reservations from 70 yrs. Still they say they are oppressed. It's mindset ashte. They are enjoying life aaramse otherwise
11/03/2019, 1:55 pm - Abhilash: Favouring is not equality theja
Wake up
11/03/2019, 1:56 pm - Lola Infosys: 35% marks get job guarantee. But not 60% marks. Their job quality will reflect in this. How will jobs progress then
11/03/2019, 1:56 pm - Vishak: No it's termed used by leftist on equity
11/03/2019, 1:56 pm - Vishak: Equality vs equity
11/03/2019, 1:56 pm - Lola Infosys: They have everything to get 60%. Still enjoy benefits and get only 35%. Totally wrong
11/03/2019, 1:58 pm - Abhilash: I am just asking if a guy with mere percentage got  into MBBS and became a doc, will u prefer going to him ?
11/03/2019, 1:58 pm - Vishak: But that logic of equity even feminist use a lot
11/03/2019, 1:58 pm - Lola Infosys: Lol.. make it mandatory to show pass percentage of doctors or on their name plates
11/03/2019, 1:59 pm - Vishak: But is proven to be assumed logic
11/03/2019, 1:59 pm - Lola Infosys: For*
11/03/2019, 1:59 pm - Lola Infosys: Wats equity in this scenario.. not getting the meaning.
11/03/2019, 2:00 pm - Vishak: <Media omitted>
11/03/2019, 2:00 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lol
11/03/2019, 2:00 pm - Vishak: So he is assuming brahmins are tat tall guy n SC is tat short guy
11/03/2019, 2:00 pm - Abhilash: 😄 obviously we will tell , ayy avnu reservation Alli bandironu, yavonu hogtane,

Similarly the society need able docs to keep it healthy
Period
11/03/2019, 2:01 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Tall guy is the one who has everything but still asking reservation
11/03/2019, 2:01 pm - Vishak: 😄😄😄
11/03/2019, 2:01 pm - Lola Infosys: Even I was abt to say same
11/03/2019, 2:02 pm - Vishak: Ya that's wat assumed logic
11/03/2019, 2:04 pm - Lola Infosys: I agree equity is required. But  after few yrs of this logic, short guy grows tall with all the favors. Next Will he stop accepting the favors and give it to still shorter ppl than him? No. He still keeps it. Thats is the wrong mindset. I want to enjoy equity irrespective if I grow tall and can manage, I still want free favors.
11/03/2019, 2:04 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: The people who took reservation should do something for the society, atleast for their community. But no one doing it
11/03/2019, 2:05 pm - Vishak: Exactly
11/03/2019, 2:05 pm - Lola Infosys: I have seen many ppl among SC/Muslims, rich guys, SUVs, imported cars, many bungalows. Still showing certificate and enjoying favors
11/03/2019, 2:05 pm - Lola Infosys: 👍🏼
11/03/2019, 2:06 pm - Lola Infosys: Equity shud be short term. Take favor, grow own balls, leave it for others to grow.
11/03/2019, 2:08 pm - Lola Infosys: Average daily pay of temple pujaris in Bangalore is 120₹ per day. They won't get favors despite being poor, why? Coz they are Brahmins. Logic
11/03/2019, 2:08 pm - Lola Infosys: I think someone shared link here , of this
11/03/2019, 2:12 pm - Vishak: Ya correct if ur poor ur weak need support which ever caste u r. And if ur rich u don't need or can't expect which ever caste u r
11/03/2019, 2:15 pm - Abhilash: Eggactly
11/03/2019, 2:26 pm - Lola Infosys: So it comes down to economical/financial based favors.
11/03/2019, 2:27 pm - Lola Infosys: But 'few' ppl oppose this 😅
11/03/2019, 2:32 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: 😅
11/03/2019, 2:33 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Still able to get 10%
11/03/2019, 2:33 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Relax for those who deserved
11/03/2019, 2:47 pm - Lola Infosys: State is given option to change it. But like the recent MP , only caste % is increased. Not this 10
11/03/2019, 2:52 pm - Lola Infosys: <Media omitted>
11/03/2019, 2:52 pm - Lola Infosys: So Moslems won't won't. Bjp wins 😂 so much for the poll
11/03/2019, 2:53 pm - Vishak: 😄
11/03/2019, 2:53 pm - Lola Infosys: Won't vote*
11/03/2019, 2:53 pm - Vishak: Wat won't vote they are active voters
11/03/2019, 2:54 pm - Vishak: They make 10 babies for 10 votes🤭
11/03/2019, 2:56 pm - Lola Infosys: I meant as joke. Some of them saying don't keep during Ramzan. So for them Religion is greater than nation. Secular 🙄
11/03/2019, 3:02 pm - Theja: In Indian education topper is not the best practical guy.

Also reg poor Brahmin , politicians see mass. 2.5 % out of 3 % are already rich. .5 % votes doesn't matter. That's why they concentrate mass.
11/03/2019, 3:06 pm - Lola Infosys: 5% brahmin. 20% obc. Total population. So according to this they shud be given full reservations
11/03/2019, 3:06 pm - Lola Infosys: Comments for this?

ಬೂತ್ ಏಜಂಟ್ ಮತ ಚಲಾವಣೆ ಮಾಡಿದವರ ಪಟ್ಟಿಯನ್ನು ಪರಿಶೀಲಿಸಿ 'ಅಣ್ಣ, ಮೇಡಂ ಓಟು ಮಾಡಿ ಹೋದರು' ಎಂದ.
ಬೇಸರದಿಂದ ರಾಜಣ್ಣ, ' ಛೇ ನಾನು ತಡವಾಗಿಬಿಟ್ಟೆ. ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ಮುಂಚೆ ಬಂದಿದ್ರೆ ಅವಳನ್ನು ಒಮ್ಮೆ ನೋಡ್ಬಹುದಿತ್ತು'

ಏಜಂಟ್: ಅವರು ನಿಮ್ಮೊಂದಿಗೆ ಇಲ್ವಾ ಅಣ್ಣ? ನೀವೇನು ಬೇರಾಗಿದ್ದೀರಾ?

ರಾಜಣ್ಣ: *ಅವಳು ಸಾವನ್ನಪ್ಪಿ 15 ವರ್ಷವಾಯಿತ್ತು. ಆದರೇ ಪ್ರತೀ ಚುನಾವಣೆಗೂ ಅವಳು ಓಟ್ ಮಾಡಲು ಬರುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾಳೆ.*

19/03/2019, 2:45 pm - Anni jss: U are thinking it's fighting.. I really don't think we are fighting with theja or those who support our opponents
19/03/2019, 2:47 pm - Anni jss: And it's not spreading agenda.. if someone corrupt would have been there, would not have asked others to vote for him.. asking people to vote one who is giving a selfless service is what Arun and I talk..

19/03/2019, 2:51 pm - Hrushikesh: If someone has already made up their mind they won't change.. like theja .. and we also have respect their choice ..and if someone is doing good people will vote them regardless of what others say.. it's up to them ..
19/03/2019, 2:52 pm - Anni jss: I respect his choice.. I am not forcing anybody to vote to one particular person, it's more of spreading awareness and request.. naan athva Arun yen kaili gun hidkond bandu Modi vote haaki Antilla

19/03/2019, 2:54 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: If person won't vote Pratap Simha in Mysuru, just avoid modi in central, then whom it will affect ? For us only right ?
19/03/2019, 2:54 pm - Anni jss: U replied too quickly my dear friend.. it was just a comparison
19/03/2019, 2:54 pm - Anni jss: Exactly..

Reg awareness we have enough sources on net and news. Simha if coalition at centre he won't Get funds. Reg Mysore Kings have lot of contribution and they are also congis.

19/03/2019, 4:41 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Looking all circumstances, only thing that pulls current govt down is the negative propoganda ashte
19/03/2019, 4:41 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Like. Go to village and say, if modi comes back, he will ban 2k notes
19/03/2019, 4:42 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Go to Muslim populated area, if modi comes back he will bring strict rules on Islam

೧. ಕೋಸಿ ನದಿ:
ಇದು ಹಿಮಾಲಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಹುಟ್ಟಿ ಬಿಹಾರದ ಮೂಲಕ ಹರಿದು ಗಂಗಾ ನದಿಯನ್ನು ಸೇರುತ್ತದೆ.
೨. ದೇವಕುಮಾರಧಾರಾ :
ಇದು ಹಾಸನದಲ್ಲಿ ಹುಟ್ಟಿ ಮಂಡ್ಯ , ರಾಮನಗರ, ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು, ಮೈಸೂರು ಹಾಗೂ ಸುತ್ತ ಮುತ್ತಲಿನ ಪ್ರದೇಶಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಹರಿದು, ಮುಗ್ಧ ( ಮುಠ್ಠಾಳ ಅಲ್ಲ) ಜನರ ಹೃದಯ ಸೇರಿ, ಅಪಾರ ಪ್ರಮಾಣದಲ್ಲಿ ಹಣ, ಮುತ್ತು, ರತ್ನ, ಮಣ್ಣು ಮರಳನ್ನು ತನ್ನ ಒಡಲಾಳದಲ್ಲಿ ತುಂಬಿಕೊಂಡು ಮತ್ತೆ ಹಾಸನವನ್ನು ಸೇರುತ್ತದೆ.
😆😆

ದೇವಕುಮಾರಾಧಾರ ಉಪನದಿಗಳು,

ನಿಖಿಲ್ ಧಾರಾ,
ಪ್ರಜ್ವಲ್ ಧಾರಾ,
ಅನಿತಾವತಿ,
ಭವಾನಿ

ಮತ್ತೊಂದು  ಚಿಕ್ಕ ಝರಿ ರಾಧಿಕಾವತಿ ಇದೆ ಕುಮಾರಧಾರ  ದ ಉಪನದಿ ಅಂತ ಹೇಳಬಹುದು.

29/03/2019, 11:21 am - Lola Infosys: House owner can be lower caste. Garbage man can be upper caste. I see only cleanliness issue.  Nothing wrong. They're is no caste angle here. Cleanliness is next to godliness . I won't let garbage man come inside house, sit on sofa and have tea. I will let him inside after cleaning himself.

03/04/2019, 9:19 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: 🙋🏾‍♂ *Wayanad*

It's a district in Kerala with a little over 8 lakh population.

It's the only place in Kerala with more than 40% Muslim population.

It's a district in Kerala, from where 5 Muslims escaped to *Syria* to join *ISIS* Terrorist organization.

It's the only district in Kerala, where no other religious celebrations take place on a large scale, other than  *Ramzan and Bakr-Id*.

It's the first place in Kerala, where during every Friday namaz the *Muslim clerics* openly call for the killings of Non- Muslims.
No authority in Kerala challenged it.

This is the place where *Rahul Gandhi* is fighting for a Lok-Sabha seat, other than from Amethi in UP

Now you know *WHY....?!*😡🤬✋🏿C M B ⛔🚫❌☠
03/04/2019, 9:24 am - Lola Infosys: Many congis confused with district and constituency. They don't know how to calculate population in both. 

Btw. It is based on 2011 census, n we know muslims reproduce in mass. If we take current scenario, Muslims are majority in many states. But govt not disclosing coz they will lose minority status

03/04/2019, 5:01 pm - Vishak: One for Hindus other for minoroties
03/04/2019, 5:02 pm - Lola Infosys: If both did same thing. Remove it from discussion. Don't talk one sided. Else talk on both sides.

Last year went to Wayanad trip. Every where this Paki type muslim flags. Every street ,shop, farms , hotels, etc. It was not election time or any. Why to display that? I felt I was in Pak only. Never saw any hindu related flags there.

Here if you put Hanuman flag, om flag or some hindu flags, you will be in ndtv breaking news next day as saffron terror.

05/04/2019, 10:32 am - Vishak: Not necessarily only because government did nothing

05/04/2019, 10:32 am - Anni jss: Panda one more thing, many govt job vacancies are their, but they are reserved, so not given for other category.. is that right?
05/04/2019, 10:32 am - Vishak: New areas of interest

05/04/2019, 10:33 am - Vishak: I want to know firstly wat do u mean jobs ter ? I will reply

05/04/2019, 10:37 am - Vishak: U can't expect all to b skilled
05/04/2019, 10:37 am - Lola Infosys: Whatever we read in engg 20% only is used in jobs. Rest one should do own research n learn. You think everyone do this?? Reskilling?
05/04/2019, 10:38 am - Vishak: See if u studied engineering and failed also basic some knowledge u will have
05/04/2019, 10:38 am - Anni jss: Yes skill is the most important thing now.. nobody is looking at people who are unskilled.. if companies wont take unskilled people what can govt do
05/04/2019, 10:38 am - Nagendra: Why not.. what stopping people to become skilled other than their mind set ?
05/04/2019, 10:39 am - Lola Infosys: Now don't say companies should give reservations. If ppl don't clear interviews, they are not skillful ashte. No one can blame govt or company
05/04/2019, 10:39 am - Vishak: Dude try to understand for starters everyone need platform
05/04/2019, 10:39 am - Anni jss: Any govt can help degree holders to gain skills can't have tie up with companies to hire
05/04/2019, 10:39 am - Vishak: I don't like concept of reservation
05/04/2019, 10:40 am - Anni jss: That's what skill India programme aimed at..
05/04/2019, 10:40 am - Anni jss: Panda talking senseless.. I'm stopping here
05/04/2019, 10:40 am - Vishak: How to tell a guy who studied engineering can't work as sweeper
05/04/2019, 10:40 am - Nagendra: Take Ur bro as example .. isn't he self motivated or is govt motivating him?? .. both u and him are equally capable.. Ur choices led to Ur job.. his choices let to his job ..
05/04/2019, 10:41 am - Theja: Let's go by fact. 
Nehru setup IIT, murthy started infy. Nagi got exp in infy . switched. Where is bjp contribution.
In fact nagi is not getting girl cos rich brahims are discriminating poor Brahmin

05/04/2019, 10:49 am - Nagendra: People are so crazy.  Like bonded labour .. 50 years ago someone did something.. still they blindly follow for generations.. no own thinking of present day..
05/04/2019, 10:50 am - Anni jss: Early man invented fire, evolution happened, Nehru's parents were born, Nehru became PM, founded IIT, we got jobs.. give credit to early man for inventing fire, else we still would have been caves
05/04/2019, 10:50 am - Anni jss: Where is contributiong of Congress in this

05/04/2019, 10:51 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: Nehru is not the first PM of India.

05/04/2019, 10:52 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: Congress will never release such facts
05/04/2019, 10:52 am - Anni jss: Oh yeah Nehru was the early man in his previous janma

05/04/2019, 10:55 am - Theja: I have one point on your side. 
Though Nehru contributed. Just by dynasty can't make rg PM without merit. Same for NY
05/04/2019, 10:56 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: Ashte, RG or Priyanka, they don't have a single experience
05/04/2019, 10:56 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: They are unfit to rule a country of billion people
05/04/2019, 10:56 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: If congress appointments Amrinder Singh for PM, then it will be tough competition
05/04/2019, 10:56 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: Otherwise shata
05/04/2019, 10:57 am - Vishak: See at least theja has a word of dissent against the party he supports

05/04/2019, 10:58 am - Vishak: That's the problem
05/04/2019, 10:58 am - Anni jss: U are wrong

05/04/2019, 10:58 am - Vishak: Any party

05/04/2019, 11:01 am - Theja: Making RG PM candidate will cost their party. They should end dyanasty. Otherwise Congress is a decent party.
05/04/2019, 11:02 am - Lola Infosys: BJp is bad.. Congress worse .. vote for BJp jai hind
05/04/2019, 11:04 am - Nagendra: Ashte theja we have always told RG beda ashte.. if Modi was in Congress we would have voted Congress only may be .. RG becoming PM or mayavati n all.. it's disastrous
05/04/2019, 11:04 am - Anni jss: If RG was of same or similar stature as modi, then could have thought.. I don't mind dynasty politics unless they are good..
05/04/2019, 11:06 am - Theja: Mayawathi is under rated. She has won in UP with no dynasty and God father.
05/04/2019, 11:07 am - Anni jss: At the end of the day, person becoming PM matters.. if he is good, then, dynasty, religion, race, dalit, brahmin should not matter..
05/04/2019, 11:07 am - Anni jss: What is the use.. she didn't do any good
05/04/2019, 11:07 am - Nagendra: Development work en madidale helappa
05/04/2019, 11:07 am - Anni jss: Just winning is not important

05/04/2019, 11:08 am - Lola Infosys: Hasn't she erected elephant statues ?? In 100acres?? If bjp was in power, they would have built temple there. Mayawati better

05/04/2019, 11:09 am - Lola Infosys: Nehru dynasty & gandhy smarakas in Delhi. 1000acres wasted. Why so much for them ?
05/04/2019, 11:11 am - Lola Infosys: As per Mayawati dalit women = elephant. She is racist and sexist and body shamer
05/04/2019, 11:11 am - Nagendra: Mayavati underrated ante 🤦🏽‍♂.. ayyo .. see panda .. people who got education under Congress aren't talking like educated 🤭
05/04/2019, 11:12 am - Lola Infosys: She won due to guundaism. Like Bengal mumtaz begum. Not from development
05/04/2019, 11:12 am - Vishak: Ya gundaraj
05/04/2019, 11:13 am - Vishak: Who is the biggest gunda becomes king ter

05/04/2019, 11:13 am - Vishak: Anyway Yogi is no good ter😆
05/04/2019, 11:15 am - Lola Infosys: He reduced guundaism. Kumb is mega success. Reclaiming history masked by invaders.
05/04/2019, 11:21 am - Theja: Basically all politicians have bodyguard goondas. Being born as dalit women and becoming cm 4times in largest state is not a joke. She has built some highways and medical colleges Google it.

05/04/2019, 11:26 am - Nagendra: Then everything will change
05/04/2019, 11:28 am - Anni jss: Apply same logic to modi.. being born in OBC community, he also became cm 4 terms continuously and then a PM.. he made gujrath one of the best states.. now who is better?
05/04/2019, 11:30 am - Vishak: A cop was killed 🤭
05/04/2019, 11:33 am - Theja: Both are good as cm.

05/04/2019, 12:14 pm - Theja: Modi's ministers are just name sake. He is just taking his own decisions without consulting experts.

05/04/2019, 4:42 pm - Anni jss: I agree that modi has brought lot of good schemes which will help middle class, poor, village people etc.. which should swing in his favour in an ideal scenario.. like 350-380

05/04/2019, 4:43 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Will wait and see, this is forward ashte, no going back for Modi

1. There are many benefit schemes by modi like for middle class, for defense people, for Muslim women, for farmers(though little),women in general as well,many other sections.. if these people who really got benefitted, votes for bjp, they bjp might even break all records.. like how rajiv did

05/04/2019, 4:49 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: RBI cuts the interest rate for loans.

Let's say you had a home loan of ₹30,00,000 for 20 years, with 8.4%.
EMI = ₹25,845. 

With this week's rate cut, expect 8.15% bank rate, which means, the monthly EMI = ₹25,374. 
You now save ₹5,652 per year, which is good! Celebrate 🙌

👉 If you find that someone has already cast your vote, then ask for "tender vote" and cast your vote.
👉If any polling booth records more than 14% tender votes, repolling will be conducted in such poling booth.
👉 Please share this very important message with maximum groups and friends as everyone should aware of their right to vote 👏👏

Even mla seats etc. You have told your relatives only there. You also said they have not helped fellow caste ppl. So now, will they give up equity n reservations now since they are benefitted from it in past and give equity to other needy? #justasking
10/04/2019, 12:29 pm - Lola Infosys: So community is full of greedy ppl according to you. Always want equity, but won't give up for needy??

The biggest offset partner 
in Rafale deal is *DRDO* 
with *₹9,000* crore, &
*Not Ambani.* 

Rest *₹21,000* is split in three main manufacturers!.
*Thales ₹6,300 crore,* 
*Dassault ₹8,400 crore &* 
*Safran ₹6,300 crore!*

*Offset for Thales is given to 12 Indian companies.*
*Offset for Dassault to 55 Indian companies!* 

*And offset for Safran to 22 Indian companies!*

*Ambani's Reliance is one of these 89 companies, clocking only about 3% of the total i.e. around ₹900 crore!*

Guess who else is there? 

*Among the known ones, L&T, Mahindra, HCL, TCS, Cap Gemini India, Titan, Wipro & Godrej!*

*To add a cherry to the cake, HAL is there too, via a JV (Joint Venture) with Safran!*

*So everything Pappu is saying, is bullshit  he knows it!*
*He thinks Indians are still fools like from his dad's & grandma's times!*

*Share it maximum.  Translate in the languages you may know!*

*No media will do this!*

*Social media is the only hope!*

And ASHAMED that I didn't even know of the devastating fire that engulfed the *thousand* year-old Meenakshi Temple recently. There was no round-the-clock coverage, no SM lament. Thank you, @TrueIndology for letting us know.

17/04/2019, 4:19 pm - Lola Infosys: One night a guy goes to get a room in a hotel. "Hello, I want a single room for the night please." "Fine, sir, here's one of our best rooms. Room 13," says the concierge and hands him the key. The guy goes upstairs, takes a shower and gets straight into bed. At about 2 0'clock in the morning, two gorgeous naked women come in and slide under the covers. When he realizes what is going on, he starts screwing both of them. He can't believe what's happening. Next morning, still surprised by last night's events, he goes downstairs to settle the bill. "How was your room sir?" asks the receptionist. "Excellent, I will come back again. What do I owe you?" asks the man. 
"Well. actually, sir, we are doing a promotional offer. Not only do you not have to pay but we give you $10 as a welcome gesture," says the receptionist. "What?" says the guy, very surprised indeed. "That's amazing." He takes the ten-dollar bill and wanders off, debating whether his buddies will believe him or not. Needless to say, after a few days he's told all his friends and neighbors about room 13 and the amazing night of passion. The next week one of his buddies goes to check out the room. "Room 13 please." "Certainly, sir, here's your key." After he gets in bed, at the same time, 2 o'clock, three girls this time, extremely horny, get in bed and screw his brains out. The next morning, not only does he not have to pay, but he too gets $10. After a month, everyone knows this hotel and especially room 13. Everyone that stays in room 13 gets the same treatment: a good screw and a ten bucks. 
After a few weeks, the story reaches the President. The President decides to check the story out for himself. He visits the hotel and asks for room 13. He gets the keys and goes upstairs. After a couple of drinks he gets in bed waiting patiently for the naked girls to appear. Indeed at about 2 0'clock in the morning two naked ladies come to bed. They are as horny and wild as all the stories the President has heard. The President gets his pecker out and screws both of them all night long. This is the night of his life. Next morning he goes to reception and when he asks how much the bill is, the receptionist says, "Nothing to pay, sir. Actually, we are doing an introductory offer. Here's $50 as a welcome gesture." Curious, the President asks the receptionist, "Well, that's strange. Everyone else who comes here gets $10. Why do I get $50?" "Well, sir," says the receptionist. "This is the first time we've filmed a porn movie with a President in it!"

Nothing is free in this World...
Don't sell yourself, unknowingly.

24/04/2019, 5:46 pm - Theja: It's not about Constitution. Amendment is required. It's about corrupt judge.
24/04/2019, 5:47 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Have you read constitution, let me send the copy I have in my computer.

24/04/2019, 5:56 pm - Nagendra: Teja rise as Arun questions Bhim constitution😅
24/04/2019, 5:57 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: It's like me being ramya asking others to vote.
24/04/2019, 5:58 pm - Theja: Nothing he has right to express. 
But only amendment is enough
24/04/2019, 5:59 pm - Nagendra: What he is telling is also ammendment only.. basically both of u mean change is required in constitution
24/04/2019, 6:00 pm - Theja: I won't defend terrorists.

28/04/2019, 4:59 pm - Lola Infosys: Lays vs. farmers, the stuff you don't know:
1. The patented potatoes in question are moisture less dry potatoes that cannot be consumed and can only be used to make confectionary products like potato chips. So the farmers wouldn't be selling this potato to the people but to pepsicos's competitors  since it's a B2B exclusive product.

2. The farmers in question are 4 landed farmers in Gujarat who are financially and socially powerful owning acres of land. They are using their influence to pit the people against lays to cover up their own theft. 

3. Yes, Theft. Because the genetically modified seed is only issued to those farmers in contract with PepsiCo and if other farmers get access to it, and start selling those potatoes to lays's competitors the hundreds of farmers in contract with lays will loose their exclusivity and profit margins. 

By suing said farmers PepsiCo is protecting the interest of hundreds of farmers who are contractually employed by the company. PepsiCo also has legal ground for these claims following legislations of intellectual property and company rights.

Yes PepsiCo is a capitalist MNC whose first priority is its profit. But still the story is not poor farmers vs PepsiCo. The farmers who were sued have jeopardized hundreds of smaller farmers in contract with PepsiCo. It is a story of rich influential people playing victim to hide their crime and of you falling victim to propaganda. Don't believe everything you see in the internet and do check the facts.

ಚಿತ್ರಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ತೋರಿಸಿರುವಂತೆ ಇವರೆಲ್ಲ ಖತರ್ನಾಕ್ ಕಳ್ಳರ ಗ್ಯಾಂಗ್...ರಾತ್ರಿ ಹೂತ್ತು ಮನೆಗಳ ಹೂರಗಡೆ ಮಕ್ಕಳು ಅಳುವ ಹಾಗೆ ಶಬ್ಧ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಾರೆ...ಒಂದು ವೇಳೆ ಬಾಗಿಲು ತೆಗೆದರೆ ಕಳ್ಳತನ ಮಾಡಿ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ದೋಚುತ್ತಾರೆ....

ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು ಇದರ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಎಚ್ಚರಿಕೆ ವಹಿಸಿ...

ಈ ವಿಷಯವನ್ನು ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಶೇರ್ ಮಾಡಿ....

A Doctor was relaxing on his sofa one evening just after arriving home from work. As he was tuning into the evening news, the phone rang. 

The doctor calmly answered it, and heard the familiar voice of a colleague on the other end of the line.

"We have already opened an aged scotch

"I'll be right over," whispered the doctor

As he was moving out, his wife asked, "Is it serious?"

"Oh yes, quite serious," said the doctor gravely.

 "In fact, three doctors are there already!"

09/05/2019, 8:08 am - Nagendra: The Japanese government has decided to dispose of all the " *microwave ovens*" in the country before the end of this year n all citizens n organizations that do not meet the requirement, are threatened with fines n prison terms.

The reason for the ban on "microwave ovens" in the land of the Rising Sun was a research by scientists from the University of Hiroshima, where they discovered that "radio waves" cause greater harm to the health of citizens over 20 years, especially when using microwave oven which is more harmful than the American atomic bombs on Hiroshima n Nagasaki in Sept 1945.

According to experts, food heated in a microwave oven has very unhealthy vibrations and radiation.

Indeed, all the largest manufacturers of "microwave ovens" in Japan are being closed where this product is manufactured.

In 2021, the production of "microwave ovens" will be stopped, as announced in South Korea, and China plans to abandon this type of technology in 2023.

A conference on cancer prevention was held at the Kashira Cancer Center n the recommendations made at the end of the conference was, these foodstuffs should be avoided:
1. Refined oil
2. Milk of animal origin (recommended soy milk)
3. Food cubes (chicken broth spices like Maggie and the like)
4. Soda (32 pieces of sugar per liter)
5. *Refined sugar*
6. Microwave ovens
7. Do not perform mammogram before birth, except echocardiography
8. Very narrow underwear n bra
9. Alcohol
10. Dissolving iced food and then refreezing it
11. Drinking water from the refrigerator in plastic bottles
12. Pills because it changes the hormonal system in women and causes cancer
13. Special deodorants when used after shaving because they cause cancer
14. *White Sugar* in any form (cancer cells feed mainly on sugar). Cancer patients should avoid sugar from their diet.

According to the recommendations of the conference, they advise to add these to your diet :
1. Vegetables
2. Honey moderately used instead of sugar
3. Plant proteins (beans instead of meat)
4. Two cups of water at body temperature on an empty stomach before brushing teeth
5. The food should be warm and not very hot
6. Aloe vera juice + ginger + parsley + celery + bromalin. We recommend mixing them and drinking them on an empty stomach
7. Carrot juice every day
8. Tomato, garlic n onion with meals

Note :
The American Physicians Association found answers to the cause of cancer:
1. Do not drink tea, coffee or anything hot in plastic cups
2. Do not eat anything hot wrapped in paper or cardboard or in a plastic bag (for example: fried potatoes)
3. Do not eat in plastic or microwave dishes

We wish to note the following:
When plastic is exposed to heat, chemical compounds that can cause 52 kinds of cancer are released.

Thus, you must avoid drinking all kinds of soft drinks such as "Cola, Pepsi, Av, Fanta n all concentrated juices.

Eat fresh pineapples and avoid pineapple juice mixture with Cola because this mixture is deadly as it will cause death to people as they think the reason is poisoning and they are the victims of their ignorance of this deadly cocktail!

Respond to calls through the left ear and better use headphones

Do not drink medicines with cold water

Do not eat heavy food after 7pm

Drink more water in the morning n less in the evening
Do not take a horizontal position (lying down/sleep) immediately after eating

When your phone battery is almost dead, do not pick up the phone, because this radiation is 1000 times stronger than the charged battery.

25/05/2019, 6:32 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: I was watching Nitin Gadkariji's interview in India Today TV, around 10.30 in the night yesterday - one of his answers brought instant tears in my eyes.. 

When Rahul Kanwal asked him what were his plans for the second term, Gadkariji said, "in the first term we concentrated a lot on highways - in the second term, we will concentrate on waterways - my first job would be to link Godavari and Krishna and thus bring water to Tamilnadu, which is facing repeated water problems"

What a man ! only yesterday, the whole Tamilnadu had voted totally against BJP, still the first plan he has is for the development of Tamilnadu !!

This is the party that TN has failed to recognize !!

ಪರೋಕ್ಷವೋ ಪ್ರತ್ಯಕ್ಷವೋ ನೀನು ಅದರ ಭಾಗಿ
27/05/2019, 12:56 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Teja voted party against development. And he say we will come back 😂
27/05/2019, 12:56 pm - Nagendra: Cum back
27/05/2019, 1:06 pm - Theja: The party you support will also do. It's just relative.
27/05/2019, 1:08 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: If BJP would have made corruption, the seat should have been decreased
27/05/2019, 1:08 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: The projects completed on time and within tenure, so ✌🏻
27/05/2019, 1:09 pm - Theja: You mean to say it's clean.
Should I Google it for you.

27/05/2019, 1:09 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Don't again say Rafael
27/05/2019, 1:09 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Rafael ruined Rahul
27/05/2019, 1:10 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Congress should fight with real things, not fake one's
27/05/2019, 1:10 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: I think India have good lesson to Congress for faking throughout
27/05/2019, 1:10 pm - Theja: Any way if I give URL you will ask book
27/05/2019, 1:11 pm - Theja: Waste of time
27/05/2019, 1:11 pm - Theja: At least bsy sriramulu
27/05/2019, 1:11 pm - Theja: Srinivas prasad I only know
27/05/2019, 1:13 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Talk about Central government man, you voting Congress in LS this time, did not helped in bringing down Sriramulu or BSY right.

That comes to Vidhansabha
27/05/2019, 1:14 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Tell what you did in Mysore, why did you went against Simha ashte question. What wrong he did here
27/05/2019, 1:14 pm - Theja: We are talking about party. So in state why you voted bsy
27/05/2019, 1:16 pm - Nagendra: Banro tea kudkond hoddadana 🤣
27/05/2019, 1:17 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: If you take Sriramulu, he did not steal money from government. He did not pay tax, even Reddy, it's called cheating to government not called corruption. Corruption is what CONgress so, taking money which are already sanctioned for public work,

BSY did I agree, Karnataka MLA election happens now, I still have doubt BSY will come to power.

But congress has people like BSY allover
27/05/2019, 1:18 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Modi is BJP national leader, he did not do, he protects nation and monitor work to be completed within tenure. Pratap Simha did some awesome work here, enough for me to vote.
27/05/2019, 1:18 pm - Theja: Then you know the answer. %age vary that's all
27/05/2019, 1:19 pm - Theja: Just like vague statements

27/05/2019, 1:19 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: You talk like my friend, she said terrosism happened in India and modi hid it. Bomb blast happened and modi hid it.
27/05/2019, 1:20 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: When you voting a common man and when you voting a corrupt family, there is a difference
27/05/2019, 1:21 pm - Theja: Prasad is corrupt family. He won. What to do now
27/05/2019, 1:22 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: What you did there ?
27/05/2019, 1:22 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Here only you failed to vote simha, you supported corruption here and they supported corruption there ashte

27/05/2019, 1:23 pm - Lola Infosys: All parties, mla, mp, are corrupt. If we see good mp, center might be corrupt, if we see good center, mp might be corrupt. Which ever is better where good %tage is more than bad %tage, we have to choose it
27/05/2019, 1:25 pm - Lola Infosys: Both teja n aruna are correct. Which ever scenario has relatively less corruption, where development can overtake it, we need to choose it
27/05/2019, 1:25 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Teja don't like Simha just because he is BJP, Chamarajanagar people didn't like Druva because he is congres, answer lies there only
27/05/2019, 2:08 pm - Lola Infosys: Sati was abolished in major parts of India earlier. Raja Ram Mohan Roy was a British puppet and used it to get all the glory of abolishing sati to himself. He was not a hindu reformer, he worked for xian conversion and believed in jesus. Wow. All these were hidden from us from schools . Trueindology is really a master of history. Exposing all the fake histories

Rahul tried hard and increase his seats from 44 to 52 which is 18% increase. Tremendous growth achieved over LY

Modi is just able to increase from 282 to 303 which is mere 7.5%.

*APPRAISAL Grade* -
*RAHUL got AA+*
*MODI got A*

*After apprisal Rahul awarded 3 week paid holidays and a trip to Italy.........And Modi was sent back to work hard and achieve more in next 5 years by improving his efficiency*😊😊

*ದುರ್ಯೋಧನ* ಮತ್ತು *ರಾಹುಲ್*
ಇಬ್ಬರೂ ದಡ್ಡರು. ಆದರೆ ಹುಟ್ಟಿನಿಂದಲೇ ಈ ಭಾರತವನ್ನಾಳಬೇಕೆಂದು ಬಯಸುತ್ತಾರೆ.

*ಭೀಷ್ಮ* ಮತ್ತು *ಅಡ್ವಾನಿ*
ಇಬ್ಬರಿಗೂ ಚಕ್ರವರ್ತಿ ಯಾಗುವ ಅರ್ಹತೆ ಯಿದ್ದರೂ ಸಿಂಹಾಸನ ಏರಲಾಗಲಿಲ್ಲ.  ಸಂದಿಗ್ದ ಸಂದರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿ ಏನೂ ಮಾಡಲಾಗಲಿಲ್ಲ.

*ಅರ್ಜುನ* ಮತ್ತು *ನರೇಂದ್ರ ಮೋದಿ*
ಇಬ್ಬರೂ ಮೇಧಾವಿಗಳು. ಧರ್ಮದಿಂದ ಮೇಲೇರಿದರೂ ಅದಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ತುಂಬಾ ಶ್ರಮಪಟ್ಟರು.

*ಕರ್ಣ* ಮತ್ತು *ಮನಮೋಹನ್ ಸಿಂಗ್*
ಇಬ್ಬರೂ ಬುದ್ದಿವಂತರು.  ಆದರೂ ಅಧರ್ಮದ ಕಡೆ ಇದ್ದದರಿಂದ ಉನ್ನತಿಯನ್ನು ಏರಲಾಗಲಿಲ್ಲ.

*ಶಕುನಿ* ಮತ್ತು *ಕೇಜ್ರಿವಾಲ್*
ಇಬ್ಬರೂ ಯಾವುದೇ ಯುದ್ಧವನ್ನು ಮಾಡದೆ ತಮ್ಮ ಕೆಟ್ಟ ನಡೆಗಳಿಂದ ಆರಕ್ಕೇರದೆ ಮೂರಕ್ಕಿಳಿಯದೆ ಹಾಗೆ ಉಳಿದರು

*ಧೃತರಾಷ್ಟ್ರ* ಮತ್ತು *ಸೋನಿಯಾ* ಮತ್ತು *ದೇವೇಗೌಡ*
ಮಕ್ಕಳ ಮೇಲಿನ ಅಂಧಾಭಿಮಾನದಿಂದ ಕುರುಡರಾಗೇ ವರ್ತಿಸಿದರು.

*ಧರ್ಮರಾಯ* ಮತ್ತು *ವಾಜಪೇಯಿ* ಸತ್ಯವಂತರು ಆದರೆ ಕುತಂತ್ರಿಗಳ ಮೋಸದಿಂದ ಪಗಡೆಯಾಟದಲ್ಲಿ ಸೋತರು

*ಶ್ರೀ ಕೃಷ್ಣ* ಮತ್ತು *ಅಬ್ದುಲ್ ಕಲಾಮ್*
ಇವರಿಬ್ಬರನ್ನೂ ನಾವು ಆರಾಧಿಸುತ್ತೇವೆ.  ಆದರೆ ಅವರಂತೆ ನಡೆಯಲು ನುಡಿಯಲು ಮನಸ್ಸಿಲ್ಲ

*ಇದೇ ಮಹಾಭಾರತ ಮತ್ತು ಇಂದಿನ ಭಾರತ*

05/06/2019, 10:18 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: *ನಾಥೂರಾಮ್ ಗೋಡ್ಸೆ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿ ಚರ್ಚೆ ನಡೆಯುತ್ತಿದೆ, ಗಾಂಧಿಯನ್ನು ಹತ್ಯೆ ಮಾಡಿದ್ದಕ್ಕೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಅವರನ್ನು ದ್ವೇಷಿಸುವ ಜನ ಅವನಲ್ಲಿದ್ದ ದೇಶಭಕ್ತಿ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಮೆಚ್ಚಲೇಬೇಕು. ಭಾರತದ ಇತಿಹಾಸದಲ್ಲಿ 1945 ರಿಂದ 1948 ರಾಜಕೀಯ ಸಂದಿಗ್ಧತೆಯ ಕಾಲ. ಹಿಂದೂಗಳ ಪರವಾಗಿ ಹಿಂದೂ ಮಹಾಸಭಾ ಹಾಗೂ ಗೋಡ್ಸೆಯಂತವರು ಬಯಸಿದ್ದನ್ನೆ, ಮುಸ್ಲೀಮರ ಪರ ಮಹಮ್ಮದ್ ಅಲಿ ಜಿನ್ನಾ ಬಯಸಿದ್ದ ಹಾಗೂ ಅದನ್ನು ಪಡೆಯುವಲ್ಲೂ ಸಫಲವಾಗಿದ್ದ. ಇದಕ್ಕೆ ಬ್ರಿಟೀಷ್ ಆಳರಸರ ತೆರೆಮರೆಯ ಬೆಂಬಲವೂ ಇತ್ತು. ಕೊನೆಗೂ 1947 ಆಗಸ್ಟ್​ 14 ನಡುರಾತ್ರಿ ದೇಶದ ಸ್ವಾತಂತ್ರ್ಯದ ಜೊತೆಗೆ ಜಿನ್ನಾ ಕಟುಕನ ಕತ್ತಿಯಿಂದ ದೇಶವನ್ನು ಇಬ್ಭಾಗ ಮಾಡಿದ್ದ. ಪರಿಣಾಮ ಎರಡೂ ದೇಶಗಳಲ್ಲೂ ಕೋಮು ಗಲಭೆಯ ಕಿಚ್ಚು ಹೊತ್ತಿಕೊಂಡಿತ್ತು.*
*ಗಾಂಧಿ ಹತ್ಯೆಯ ನಂತರ ನಡೆದ ಕೋರ್ಟ್​ ವಿಚಾರಣೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಾನೇಕೆ ಗಾಂಧಿಯನ್ನು ಹತ್ಯೆ ಮಾಡಿದೆ ಎಂದು ಗೋಡ್ಸೆ ತನ್ನ ಪರ ವಾದವನ್ನು ಸವಿವರವಾಗಿ ಮಂಡಿಸಿದ್ದ, ಗಾಂಧಿ ಹತ್ಯೆಯನ್ನು ಸಮರ್ಥಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದ. ಗಾಂಧೀಜಿ ವಿರುದ್ಧ ಆತನ ತಕರಾರೆಂದರೆ...?*

*ಗಾಂಧಿ ಹತ್ಯೆಗೆ ನಾಥೂರಾಮ್ ಗೋಡ್ಸೆ ಕೋರ್ಟ್ನಲ್ಲಿ ಕೊಟ್ಟಿದ್ದ 10 ಮುಖ್ಯ ಕಾರಣಗಳೇನು ಗೊತ್ತಾ...!*

*1. ಅಖಂಡ ಭಾರತ ನಿರ್ಮಾಣ ನನ್ನ ಕನಸು. ಗಾಂಧೀಜಿಯಿಂದಾಗಿ ದೇಶ ವಿಭಜನೆಯಾಗಿ ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನ ನಿರ್ಮಾಣವಾಯಿತು..!*

*2. ದೇಶದ ಮೂರನೇ ಒಂದು ಭಾಗ ಆಗಸ್ಟ್ 15, 1947ರಂದು ವಿದೇಶವಾಗಿ ಹೋಯಿತು. ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಕಾರಣ ಗಾಂಧಿ...!*

*3. ದೇಶವೇ ಸಂಕಷ್ಟದಲ್ಲಿದ್ದಾಗ ಗಾಂಧೀಜಿ ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನಕ್ಕೆ 55 ಕೋಟಿ ಪರಿಹಾರ ಕೊಡಿ ಎಂದು ಉಪವಾಸಕ್ಕೆ ಕುಳಿತಿದ್ದರು ಇದು ಸರಿಯಲ್ಲ...!*

*4. ಗಾಂಧೀಜಿಯ ಮುಸ್ಲಿಂ ಓಲೈಕೆಯಿಂದಾಗಿಯೇ ದೇಶ ವಿಭಜನೆಯಾಗಿದ್ದು...!*

*5. ದೇಶ ವಿಭಜನೆಯಾಗಿ ಗಡಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹಿಂದೂಗಳ ಮಾರಣಹೋಮವಾಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದರೂ ಗಾಂಧಿ ಮೌನ ವಹಿಸಿದ್ದರು...!*

*6. ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನದಿಂದ ಬಂದ ಹಿಂದೂ ನಿರಾಶ್ರಿತರಿಂದ ತುಂಬಿ ಹೋಗಿದ್ದ ಮಸೀದಿ ಖಾಲಿ ಮಾಡಿ ಮುಸ್ಲಿಮರಿಗೆ ಜಾಗ ಕೊಡಿ ಎಂದು ಗಾಂಧಿ ಉಪವಾಸ ಕುಳಿತಿದ್ದರು...!*

*7. ದೇಶದಲ್ಲೇ ಉಳಿದುಕೊಂಡ ಮುಸ್ಲಿಮರಿಗೆ ಆಶ್ರಯ ನೀಡಬೇಕು ಎಂದು ಗಾಂಧಿ ಒತ್ತಾಯಿಸಿದರು...!*

*8. ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನದಿಂದ ಭಾರತಕ್ಕೆ ಬಂದ ನಿರಾಶ್ರಿತ ಹಿಂದೂಗಳ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಗಾಂಧಿ ಕಿಂಚಿತ್ತೂ ಕರುಣೆ ತೊರಲಿಲ್ಲ...!*

*9. ಗಾಂಧಿಯನ್ನು ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರಪಿತ ಎನ್ನುವುದಾದರೆ ಅವರು ಆ ಸ್ಥಾನವನ್ನು ಸರಿಯಾಗಿ ನಿಭಾಯಿಸಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಗಾಂಧಿ ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನದ ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರಪಿತ...!*

*10. ಗಾಂಧಿ ಇಲ್ಲದ ಭಾರತ ಶಕ್ತಿಶಾಲಿಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ ಎಂಬ ಕಾರಣಕ್ಕೆ ಗಾಂಧಿಯನ್ನು ಕೊಂದೆ..!*

But not a single word came out of my wife’s mouth that take him home with you for four days......

19/06/2019, 12:23 pm - Hrushikesh: ROFL
19/06/2019, 12:41 pm - Hrushikesh: *Corporate joke* 

The marketing Director of Nescafe manages to meet with the Pope at the Vatican.

After receiving the papal blessing, the Nescafe official whispers: 'Your Eminence, I have some business to discuss. We at Nescafe have an offer for you. Nescafe is prepared to donate $100 million to the church if you change the Lord's Prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily coffee'."

The Pope looks outraged & thunders: "That is impossible. The Prayer is the word of the Lord. It must not be changed." 

"Well," says the Nescafe man somewhat chastened, "We anticipated your reluctance.
For this reason, and the importance of the Lord's prayer to all Catholics, we will increase our offer to $300 million. All we require is that you change the Lord's Prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily coffee'."

Again, even more sternly, the Pope replies, "That, my son, is impossible. For the prayer is the word of the Lord and it must not be changed."

Finally, the Nescafe Director says, "Your Holiness, we at Nescafe respect your adherence to the faith, we realise that tradition is essential to your beliefs, we fully understand the importance of the word of the Lord but we do have one final offer.

Please discuss it with your cardinals. We will donate $500 million to the great Catholic church if you could only change the Lord's
Prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily coffee'. 

Please, please consider it. And he leaves.

The next day the Pope convenes the College of Cardinals. 

"There is some Good news," he announces, "and some bad news !!"

'The good news is, he continues to a hushed assembly', ' that the Church will get $ 500 million."

"And what is the bad news, your Holiness?" asks a Cardinal.

"Sadly" says the Pope, We would have to lose the Britannia Account."

27/06/2019, 10:30 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: Very Interesting facts! 

Christianity ….One Christ, One Bible Religion…

But the Latin Catholic will not enter Syrian Catholic Church.

These two will not enter Marthoma Church .

These three will not enter Pentecost Church .

These four will not enter Salvation Army Church.

These five will no enter Seventh Day Adventist Church .

These six will not enter Orthodox Church.

These seven will not enter Jacobite church.

This way there are 146 castes  alone for Christianity. 

Each will never share their churches with fellow Christians!

One Christ, One Bible, One Jehova???

Now Muslims..! One Allah, One Quran, One Nabi....! Great unity?

Among Muslims, Shia and Sunni hate and  kill each other in all Muslim countries.

The religious riots in most Muslim countries is always between these two sects.

The Shia will not go to Sunni Mosque. 

These two will not go to Ahamadiya Mosque. 

These three will not go to Sufi Mosque. 

These four will not go to Mujahiddin mosque.

This way there are 13 castes in Muslims. 

Killing/bombing/conquering/ massacaring/... each  other!

American attack on Iraq was fully supported by all Muslim countries surrounding Iraq ! 

One Allah, One Quran, One Nabi....????

Hindus - 

They have 1,280 Religious Books, 10,000 Commentaries, more than one lakh sub-commentaries for these foundation books,  innumerable presentations of one God, variety of Aacharyas, thousands of Rishies, hundreds of languages.

Still they all go to All  TEMPLES and they are peaceful and tolerant and seek unity with others by inviting them to worship with them whatever God they wish to pray for!

Hindus never fought one another for the last ten thousand years in the name of religion.

 *Be very proud to be a HINDU*

ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮೀ ಪ್ರತ್ಯಕ್ಷಳಾದಳು.

ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮೀ: ಶೆಟ್ರೇ ಏನು ಬೇಕು?
ಶೆಟ್ರು: ದುಡ್ಡು ಬೇಕು!

ಎರಡು ಗೋಣಿಚೀಲದಷ್ಟು ದುಡ್ಡು ಕೊಟ್ಟು ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಿ ಮಾಯವಾದಳು. ಶೆಟ್ರು ಖುಷಿಯಿಂದ ಮನೆಗೆ ಬಂದು ಗೋಣಿ ಚೀಲಗಳನ್ನು ಬಿಚ್ಚಿ ನೋಡಿ ಬೆಚ್ಚಿ ಬಿದ್ದರು.
ಆ ಗೋಣಿಚೀಲಗಳಲ್ಲಿದ್ದುದು ₹500 ಮತ್ತು ₹1000 ದ ಹಳೆಯ ನೋಟುಗಳು!
ಶೆಟ್ರು ಪುನಃ ತಪಸ್ಸು ಮಾಡಿದರು.

ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮೀ ಪ್ರತ್ಯಕ್ಷಳಾಗಿ ಕೇಳಿದಳು: 
" ಏನಾಯಿತು ಶೆಟ್ರೇ?"

ಶೆಟ್ರು ಹೇಳಿದರು: 
"ಇವೆಲ್ಲವೂ ಹಳೆಯ ನೋಟುಗಳು! ಇವುಗಳಿಗೆ ಈಗ ಬೆಲೆಯಿಲ್ಲ"

ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಿ: "ಶೆಟ್ರೇ, ನಾನೂ ಕೂಡಾ ಹಳೆಯ ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮಿ,, ನೋಟ್ ಬದಲಾವಣೆ ಮಾಡಿದ್ದು ಮೋದಿ.. *ಓಟ್ ಮೋದಿಗೆ ಹಾಕ್ತಿರಾ ನೋಟ್ ನನಗೆ ಕೇಳ್ತಿರಾ..? ಲಾಟಿ ಚಾರ್ಜ್ ಮಾಡಿಸಬೇಕಾ..?*

ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮೀ ಮಾಯವಾದಳು.

01/07/2019, 10:40 am - Hrushikesh: Ya.. to avoid Pak from reaching semi
01/07/2019, 10:41 am - Hrushikesh: But each game we need to play correctly

01/07/2019, 10:50 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: 80 runs in 40 balls with 5 wicket was doable, but deliberately failed.
01/07/2019, 10:50 am - Nagendra: It's all planned

01/07/2019, 10:59 am - Nagendra: Knowing people like Dhoni he won't give up like that.. even if he plays slow at end he will atleast try.. yesterday he didn't try at all..
01/07/2019, 11:01 am - Lola Infosys: There are many with almost same SR as dhoni. But ppl bashing only Dhoni

01/07/2019, 11:06 am - Nagendra: It's not about strike rate.. if Dhoni had tried to hit six and got out nobody would have blamed.. nobody blaming Hardik or pant.. but Dhoni and Kedar playing singles like test match 😅
01/07/2019, 11:07 am - Vishak: Start was also slow
01/07/2019, 11:07 am - Vishak: Y u r not blaming it
01/07/2019, 11:08 am - Vishak: Ya kedar dabba batsmen I agree
01/07/2019, 11:08 am - Vishak: But still I feel more of team effort
01/07/2019, 11:08 am - Lola Infosys: Hardik n dhoni same SR. How is he different?
01/07/2019, 11:08 am - Nagendra: U won't understand leave
01/07/2019, 11:08 am - Vishak: I don't think we must break our heads for this match
01/07/2019, 11:09 am - Vishak: I feel the way Bangladesh
01/07/2019, 11:09 am - Vishak: Chanced was perfect example to chase
01/07/2019, 11:09 am - Nagendra: It's like u r saying we lost toss why not blame on it 😅..
01/07/2019, 11:10 am - Vishak: Arey they started slowly
01/07/2019, 11:10 am - Vishak: Wat is to do with toss
01/07/2019, 11:11 am - Nagendra: 40 ball 80 runs .  For big IPL players is nothing.. even if kohli was there or Hardik was there or who ever who plays singles in that situation is bad
01/07/2019, 11:11 am - Nagendra: No point in playing defense and conserving wicket
01/07/2019, 11:12 am - Vishak: Ya fault is ter from lower order
01/07/2019, 11:12 am - Vishak: But it's collective fault
01/07/2019, 11:12 am - Vishak: Top order , bowling everything
01/07/2019, 11:13 am - Nagendra: 😏
01/07/2019, 11:13 am - Vishak: Only person I feel fully u can blame is kedar
01/07/2019, 11:13 am - Vishak: That guy is waste
01/07/2019, 11:13 am - Nagendra: For a person of Dhoni calibre it's not acceptable to give reasons like that.. Oyo CEO can't tell Vishak didn't perform so we went into loss
01/07/2019, 11:14 am - Nagendra: Senior players with high potential should take responsibility and blame
01/07/2019, 11:14 am - Nagendra: Dhoni is known to be match finisher not Kedar
01/07/2019, 11:15 am - Nagendra: Kedar will tell I was not wasting balls I was giving strike to Dhoni
01/07/2019, 11:21 am - Vishak: Ok hope ur valuable feedback will b useful for team India
01/07/2019, 11:23 am - Nagendra: Panda urkonda 🤭
01/07/2019, 11:23 am - Vishak: Wat urkonda😑
01/07/2019, 11:23 am - Vishak: I didn't mind only yesterday loss
01/07/2019, 11:24 am - Vishak: It's good to loose before senis
01/07/2019, 11:24 am - Vishak: Semis
01/07/2019, 11:24 am - Vishak: Then u will know that u r not invencible
01/07/2019, 11:25 am - Vishak: Unless u don't loose u won't think ter is any problem
01/07/2019, 11:25 am - Vishak: Now team will think wat went wrong
01/07/2019, 11:26 am - Nagendra: Guru it was like losing purposefully that's what I am trying to say
01/07/2019, 11:26 am - Vishak: May b 😬
01/07/2019, 11:26 am - Nagendra: Shata ashte I am saying
01/07/2019, 11:26 am - Nagendra: Nobody has problem with losing
01/07/2019, 11:27 am - Nagendra: But purposefully they played singles and lost
01/07/2019, 11:27 am - Vishak: May b
01/07/2019, 11:27 am - Vishak: But I don't think any use
01/07/2019, 11:27 am - Nagendra: 😏

16/07/2019, 10:25 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: *Country’s first bio-CNG plant* 

The process of CNG generation  from agricultural waste involves treating the waste with a special bacterial solution, after which the gas so generated is cleaned and compressed for use in vehicles.
 
India’s first bio-CNG plant Commissioned by city-based Primove Engineering Private Limited, this plant use agricultural residue to generate CNG which is used in automobiles as fuel.
*Santosh Gondhalekar*, director, research and development, said the idea of using agricultural residue for generation of CNG was considered as the problem of disposal of agricultural waste was a major concern in the country. “600 million tonnes of agricultural waste is generated per year in the country. With every few uses of this residue, most of it is wasted. Bagasse which is generated after crushing of sugarcane is mostly used as dry fodder for the mills also,” he said.


The process of generation of CNG from agricultural waste involves treating the waste with a special bacterial solution, after which the gas so generated is cleaned and compressed for use in vehicles. The plant is located in Pirangut, Pune, has been set up as a Proof of Concept (PoC) which can be replicated elsewhere.

The company has invested around Rs 4.5 crore in the plant and has received  a process patent. 

With Rs 20 crore of investment, standalone plant is under process near Nagpur.

Father: This is ridiculous. If marks are equal, then both should have been declared Joint 1st Rank Holders na? By the way, how come he got 1st Rank? On what basis?

Son : I checked that too. Principal said it was decided based on how many additional sheets were taken by us while writing the exams.  He had taken more than me. So.....

The wife checked  her husband's phone and found these names:

- The Tender one 
- The Amazing one 
- Lady of my Dreams

She got angry and called the first number to find out that was his Mother. Then she called the second number on which his Sister replied.
When she dialed the third  number, her own phone rang !!

She cried until her eyes got swollen because she had doubted  her innocent husband, So she gave him her whole month's salary to make up for it...
 
Husband took the money and bought a gift for his girlfriend whose name was saved as
"Ghafoor Bhai mechanic”

ಮರಕ್ಕೆ ಇಷ್ಟವಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ.

 ಮರ ಕೂರ  ಬೇಡವೆಂದರೂ ಗೂಬೆ ಕೇಳಲಿಲ್ಲ.

ಒಂದು ದಿನ ಬಡಗಿ ಮರವನ್ನು ಕಡಿದು ಹಾಕಿದ.

 ಮರಕ್ಕೆ ಎಲ್ಲಿಲ್ಲದ ಆನಂದ, ಕೊನೆಗೂ ಗೂಬೆಯಿಂದ ಬಿಡುಗಡೆ ದೊರಕಿತು ಎಂಬ ಖುಷಿ. 

ಆದರೆ, ಆ ಖುಷಿ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಕಾಲ ಉಳಿಯಲಿಲ್ಲ. 

ಬಡಗಿ ಆ ಮರವನ್ನು ಕತ್ತರಿಸಿ *ವಿಧಾನ ಸಭೆಯ ಕುರ್ಚಿಗಳಾಗಿ*   ಮಾಡಿದ ..!

ಪುನಃ ಆ ಕುರ್ಚಿಗಳ ಮೇಲೆ ಗೂಬೆಗಳೇ ಬಂದು ಕೂತವು !!🤣

22/07/2019, 3:32 pm - Nagendra: Ade .. 
One way to look at it is it makes country powerful .. research is important n all.. 

Another way to look at is.. countries like Switzerland Australia and all haven't done these kind of things but still they r better places to live than India... They have utilised money and resources to improve present life not try to find life in other planets and moon..

22/07/2019, 4:30 pm - Lola Infosys: Very less. Coz we are not going directly to moon. We are doing rounds around earth to gain momentum and then release off from gravity. Same like Mars mission. 
Directly flying to moon with fuel is lakhs of crores, which NASA did for mars
22/07/2019, 4:31 pm - Lola Infosys: Sarcastic we know
22/07/2019, 4:31 pm - Nagendra: So what now.. u feel 1000 crore can't help anyone in India so they can spend on finding shit on moon
22/07/2019, 4:32 pm - Lola Infosys: I just told how cheap isro did it. NASA spent lakhs for same thing. We are reducing cost
22/07/2019, 4:32 pm - Vishak: Lo this nagi not getting very cheap it is
22/07/2019, 4:32 pm - Vishak: Ya I respect isro

22/07/2019, 4:33 pm - Lola Infosys: I agree this moon mission won't help common man , atleast our generation. But isro did it like 1/10 th or 1/20th the cost of nasa
22/07/2019, 4:33 pm - Vishak: Ya
22/07/2019, 4:34 pm - Vishak: NASA simply spends I have seen

22/07/2019, 4:36 pm - Vishak: All will b rich
22/07/2019, 4:38 pm - Lola Infosys: SpaceX planing commercial space flights. This is utter waste. Just go to space, see outside, feel weightlessness n come back. 1000000$ for one ticket.
22/07/2019, 4:38 pm - Lola Infosys: Spending for exploration is better. So ya, isro mission is good in that sense
22/07/2019, 4:38 pm - Vishak: Ya waste

22/07/2019, 5:45 pm - Vishak: 70% of population was on but 30% not acceptable
22/07/2019, 5:45 pm - Theja: If 20000cr is tax 100000 cr people are spending to buy and later cure disease. As a whole we are spending unnecessary.

22/07/2019, 5:49 pm - Theja: Tobacco and alcohol is luxury for this nation. 
Isro is need.
22/07/2019, 5:50 pm - Vishak: Ya correct

12/08/2019, 2:54 pm - Lola Infosys: In the link I shared, trueindology, there are 20+ names of descendants. Further research you do.

12/08/2019, 2:55 pm - Vishak: I know it's faith ppl get emotional
12/08/2019, 2:55 pm - Lola Infosys: SC is deviating . Fight is only for temple building. Already proof is there for temple below mosque. Why they want descendants proof? Tika muchkond build temple anbek. Ask SC not to deviate.
12/08/2019, 2:56 pm - Vishak: U dont deviate
12/08/2019, 2:56 pm - Vishak: Give me proof

12/08/2019, 2:56 pm - Vishak: Faith is something and fact is something
12/08/2019, 2:57 pm - Lola Infosys: Main topic is temple building or mosque building
Correct? 

We can still see, even today temple below mosque.
Archeological survey of India has also mentioned temple is there. 

Why SC wants descendants proof? I don't understand this
12/08/2019, 2:57 pm - Vishak: Dude y u deviating topic
12/08/2019, 2:57 pm - Vishak: I don't want to debate shit
12/08/2019, 2:57 pm - Vishak: Give me proof they are descendants
12/08/2019, 2:57 pm - Vishak: U will tell whatever I can't believe
12/08/2019, 2:58 pm - Lola Infosys: If SC can ask descendants of temple ( which was built first) , why can't it ask descendants of mosque ppl, which is built on top of temple
12/08/2019, 2:58 pm - Lola Infosys: Simple
12/08/2019, 2:58 pm - Lola Infosys: Tell this
12/08/2019, 2:59 pm - Vishak: Yes they must ask doesn't mean u bring stupid illogical argument of descendants
12/08/2019, 2:59 pm - Vishak: Ram temple the proof is enough that there was a ram statue previously before mosque
12/08/2019, 2:59 pm - Lola Infosys: Who brought that illogical argument?? SC brought it. If they can, I can also . 😁
12/08/2019, 2:59 pm - Lola Infosys: Yes
12/08/2019, 3:00 pm - Lola Infosys: Case closed.
12/08/2019, 3:00 pm - Vishak: So I can laugh at descendants proof🤭

12/08/2019, 3:04 pm - Vishak: They will build ram temple by passing a Constitutional order don't worry simply do work 😑
12/08/2019, 3:04 pm - Lola Infosys: Also constitution has a section which says to give nod first. Later based on case outcome can give compensation. So can build temple now. Later if crooks produce fake proof and by chance mosque wins, can give money compensation. That is legal also
12/08/2019, 3:05 pm - Vishak: It can't b done even before court decide
12/08/2019, 3:05 pm - Vishak: There are some loop hole

20/08/2019, 5:42 pm - Bhavan Play: Two engineering students are waiting to give their oral viva test. The first student's turn comes, and he goes inside

External 😌:-  Suppose you are travelling by a train, and suddenly it gets hot, what will you do?

Student😌:- I will open the window.

External 🤪:- Great, now suppose that the area of the window is1.5 sq.m and the volume of the compartment is 12 m3, the train is travelling at 80 km/hr in a Westerly direction and the speed of the wind is 5 m/s from the South, then how much time will  it take for the compartment to get cold?

The student can't answer, so he is marked fail and he comes out. After coming out he tells that question to the second student.

The second student goes in and his viva starts.

External 😊:- Suppose you are travelling by a train, and suddenly it gets hot, what will you do?

2nd Student 😌:- I will remove my coat.

External 🤨:- It still is hot, then what?

Student😌:- I will remove my shirt.

External (angrily) 😤:- If it still is hot, then what will you do?

Student😌:- I will remove my pant.

External (Fuming) 😡:- And what if you die due to the heat?

Student:- Naan satru parvagilla... Aa window na maatra tegiyalla

25/08/2019, 2:52 pm - Vishak: Ya many dishes I searched
25/08/2019, 2:52 pm - Vishak: Use hot curd
25/08/2019, 2:53 pm - Vishak: In aryurveda wat they tell abt curd mainly is one thing if u eat curd empty stomach a little bit it helps in digestion
25/08/2019, 2:54 pm - Vishak: Also scientifically it shows the bacteria reacts in empty stomach
25/08/2019, 2:54 pm - Vishak: But I don't see much any hot Rice and curd
25/08/2019, 2:54 pm - Lola Infosys: Maybe all these hot curd dishes shud be taken immediately after preparation so that curd doesn't react
25/08/2019, 2:54 pm - Lola Infosys: If kept, ,it may spoil
25/08/2019, 2:54 pm - Vishak: One more thing is curd must b taken last
25/08/2019, 2:55 pm - Vishak: Only these things u have both scientific n aryurvedic explanation
25/08/2019, 2:55 pm - Lola Infosys: Why this topic started?😅
25/08/2019, 2:55 pm - Vishak: But not for curd and hot rice
25/08/2019, 2:55 pm - Lola Infosys: Who started this debate?
25/08/2019, 2:55 pm - Vishak: Yesterday bhavan told if I eat hot rice and curd I will get cancer😳
25/08/2019, 2:55 pm - Vishak: I was like wtf
25/08/2019, 2:56 pm - Nagendra: https://www.livechennai.com/healthnews.asp?newsid=30865&catid=10
25/08/2019, 2:56 pm - Lola Infosys: Anything in excess is bad. Little now n then is ok
25/08/2019, 2:56 pm - Abhilash: 😲
25/08/2019, 2:57 pm - Vishak: I don't have only curd often
25/08/2019, 2:57 pm - Lola Infosys: You will get aids from pros before that.. so don't worry
25/08/2019, 2:57 pm - Vishak: 😄
25/08/2019, 2:57 pm - Lola Infosys: Curd is very good for digestion. I have daily in meals
25/08/2019, 2:57 pm - Abhilash: 😁
25/08/2019, 2:59 pm - Nagendra: Panda let me explain .. 

Milk u buy.. heat it.. cool it.. then it becomes curd.. 

If u buy milk and after one day u heat it.. it gets spoiled.. or heated milk while in process of becoming curd u heat it again ..it gets spoiled.. 

So basically after it becomes curd.. it will have probiotics which are good bacteria to aid digestion.. so if u mix curd with hot rice those good bacteria n all gets killed.. so curd gets spoiled.. just like it u boil curd it gets spoiled..
25/08/2019, 3:00 pm - Nagendra: This is the science I know
25/08/2019, 3:00 pm - Nagendra: If u still want to eat ..eat ..I don't care 😅
25/08/2019, 3:00 pm - Vishak: No tat point is wrong I know u will come up with it
25/08/2019, 3:01 pm - Vishak: If u take only curd in empty stomach only u can utilize the use of lacto bacillus
25/08/2019, 3:01 pm - Vishak: If u had stomach filled and eat curd it will act as a supplement not help u in digestion anyway
25/08/2019, 3:02 pm - Nagendra: U take some curd keep it on gas and heat it.. see if it gets spoiled or not.. go experiment it..
25/08/2019, 3:03 pm - Vishak: Heat it means obviously depends on temperature
25/08/2019, 3:03 pm - Vishak: Hot rice won't b so hot as boiling a curd
25/08/2019, 3:04 pm - Nagendra: <Media omitted>
25/08/2019, 3:04 pm - Vishak: OK but I will eat it with cold rice only 😁

31/08/2019, 9:41 pm - Vishak: It's may be a hardcore recession this time, which already spreads it's poison in the economy of India. Almost 13.67percent fall in overall economic marker is recorded. Foreign exchange, repo rate is also indicating that crisis started. Already 17Lakh of employee lost job in last quarter. Prepare and get ready for the bad times...
You can follow this steps-
1. Try to minimise extra expenses
2. Try to avoid big buying in next 6month
3. Avoid investment now, nobody knows SIP and trading will bring what amount of loss,since all are depends on the recovery.
4. Don't buy gold now, likely the price will fall from December
5. Mediocre people, small business will suffer the most, so make your budget tight.
6. Online purchase can be risky, since sites are already in loss.
7. Convert / consume all your digital money( Paytm,Gpay etcetc) into physical fund.
8. Priorities your family expenses.
9. Stay alert - snatching on roads,robbery will increase from coming festive season.
10. Try to cumulate at least your 6 month expenses from now on. The situation may be worst from November December 2019. It may persist till mid of 2020.

Please be alert, and circulate it like a responsible citizen, with your close friends.

ನೂತನ ಸಂಚಾರಿ ದಂಡ ಪಾವತಿ ಮೈಸೂರು ನಗರದಲ್ಲಿ ನಾಳೆಯಿಂದ ಜಾರಿಗೆ. ವಿಮೆ ಇಲ್ಲದೆ ವಾಹನ ಚಾಲನೆ ಮಾಡಿದ್ರೆ ಮೊದಲ ಬಾರಿಗೆ 2 ಸಾವಿರ ರೂ, ಎರಡನೇ ಬಾರಿ ಮತ್ತೆ ಉಲ್ಲಂಘನೆ ಮಾಡಿದರೆ 4 ಸಾವಿರ ರೂ. ದಂಡ ಅಥವಾ 3 ತಿಂಗಳು ಜೈಲು ಶಿಕ್ಷೆ.

07/09/2019, 8:43 am - Vishak: It would have been great moment for India
07/09/2019, 8:45 am - Vishak: We must try manned mission next
07/09/2019, 8:45 am - Lola Infosys: NDTV journalists shouting at scientists , Caught on camera.  🤦🏻‍♂
Ndtv never learns
07/09/2019, 8:46 am - Vishak: Show?
07/09/2019, 8:46 am - Vishak: I doubt
07/09/2019, 8:46 am - Lola Infosys: 95% of experiments is with the orbitor. 5% was with rover. We still have success
07/09/2019, 8:46 am - Vishak: No man
07/09/2019, 8:46 am - Lola Infosys: Check twitter. Everyone sharing that video
07/09/2019, 8:46 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lo you guys are over exaggerating

07/09/2019, 8:47 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: All the countries failed in space
07/09/2019, 8:47 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: That's it
07/09/2019, 8:47 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: It is just a glitch
07/09/2019, 8:47 am - Vishak: U mean Vikram still ter??😳

07/09/2019, 8:48 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: One more orbiter is still revolving actively around moon
07/09/2019, 8:48 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: It is not complete failure, that orbiter will surely collect some data
07/09/2019, 8:49 am - Lola Infosys: Yes.. 1km fall in less gravity won't crash. It would have landed. Maybe rover also moving. But no communication . Just a hope. Even if crashed, orbitor was the main part of this mission
07/09/2019, 8:50 am - Vishak: 😡 worst guru
07/09/2019, 8:51 am - Lola Infosys: NASA n China has failed 10 moon missions .

07/09/2019, 8:55 am - Nagendra: The lander was predicted to take one path for landing.. the trajectory changed when it was 2.1km away from moon..there seems to be sudden dive.. it looks like the engine which had to control the speed of landing didn't fire and there was sudden landing which could have crashed the lander
07/09/2019, 8:55 am - Vishak: Ya I also think it crashed
07/09/2019, 8:56 am - Vishak: The orbiter will send photo
07/09/2019, 8:56 am - Lola Infosys: But I feel low gravity. It will not crash n get destroyed fully

07/09/2019, 10:44 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lander development history ;

On 12 November 2007, representatives of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) and ISRO signed an agreement for the two agencies to work together on the Chandrayaan-2 project.ISRO would have the prime responsibility for the orbiter and rover, while Roscosmos was to provide the lander. The Indian government approved the mission in a meeting of the Union Cabinet, held on 18 September 2008 and chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The design of the spacecraft was completed in August 2009, with scientists of both countries conducting a joint review.

Although ISRO finalised the payload for Chandrayaan-2 per schedule, the mission was postponed in January 2013 and rescheduled to 2016 because Russia was unable to develop the lander on time. Roscosmos later withdrew in wake of the failure of the Fobos-Grunt mission to Mars, since the technical aspects connected with the Fobos-Grunt mission were also used in the lunar projects, which needed to be reviewed.When Russia cited its inability to provide the lander even by 2015, India decided to develop the lunar mission independently.

"In my next life I want to live my life backwards. You start out dead and get that out of the way. Then you wake up in an old people's home feeling better every day. You get kicked out for being too healthy, go collect your pension, and then when you start work, you get a gold watch and a party on your first day. You work for 40 years until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement. You party, drink alcohol, and are generally promiscuous, then you are ready for high school. You then go to primary school, you become a kid, you play. You have no responsibilities, you become a baby until you are born. And then you spend your last 9 months floating in luxurious spa-like conditions with central heating and room service on tap, larger quarters every day and then Voila! You finish off as an orgasm!"

Bloody brilliant

10/09/2019, 4:09 pm - Anni jss: *Buying a Car* v/s *Hire* a Cab : 
A superb *Analysis* 

Any car  in india cost atleast Rs. 6,00,000
Scrap value after six year -  Rs. 1,00,000
Net amount goes in effective Life of six year  Rs. 5,00,000

Nos of days of six yr is 2200 days

So Rs. 5,00,000/2200
= Rs. 230/day

Yearly insurance Rs 15000 = Rs. 41/day

Daily petrol minimum 
= Rs. 100/Day

After every 3 years Tyre & Battery change charge Rs. 25,000 i.e. = Rs. 23/day

Yearly maintenance of
Car Rs. 9000 i.e 
= Rs. 25/day

Plus interest loss on
Car buying amount
@8%on Rs. 6,00,000 = Rs 131/day                                           _______________
So after buying a new car *daily expenditure = Rs. 850/day.* 

⚖

So friends untill you pay Rs. 850 daily to hire a cab, you are effectively in gain travelling in rental car. 

OLA/UBER now available.

Above all, driving cars on the Indian roads is full of risk added with Mental tension/BP...

New hefty Traffic challans not included. 

Can this be the real reason behind recession in the automobile industry?

Somewhere between 
“ 10 toffees for 1 rupee” and 
“1 toffee for 10 rupees”, 
we grew up!

Somewhere between 
“Ground mai aaja” and 
“Online aaja”, 
we grew up!

Somewhere between 
“stealing chocolate from our sister” and “Buying chocolate for her children”, 
we grew up!

Somewhere between 
“Just five more mins Maa” and “Pressing the snooze button”, 
we grew up!

Somewhere between 
“Crying out loud just to get what we want” and 
“Holding our tears when we are broken inside”, 
we grew up!

Somewhere between 
“I want to grow up” and 
“I want to be a child again”, 
we grew up!

Somewhere between 
“Lets meet and plan” and 
“Lets plan and meet”, 
we grew up!

Somewhere between 
"Being afraid of our parents"
and 
"Praying for our parents" we finally grew up  

And as we grew up, we realize;

*How silently, our lives have changed.......*

16/09/2019, 7:59 pm - Lola Infosys: North India doesn't speak hindi. Not even 50%. 
Marathi gujurathi Bengali Punjabi like these make up more than 60% spoken language. So it's not that north vs South also. And it's not hindi is major lang in north also. Since everyone knows it and can understand, they are trying to make it common lang

Successess :
Building HOPE

Faced by : Low/middle class ppl

16/09/2019, 8:22 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Yes man, i believe any govt not let any one fall, even if Siddarth died, coffee day and it's employee doing their jobs.

I agree with you, some additional tax have been imposed, they tried to make every money count, it did gave some effect, but job ella biddu jana beedige baro range ge agilla, i believe they will correct it as soon as they feel it going down
16/09/2019, 8:23 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: It's better than being Lifetime Gulam to one party without any development
16/09/2019, 8:23 pm - Nagendra: Many people have committed suicide due to loss in stock market after budget

16/09/2019, 8:25 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Earlier people were scared to take engineering courses, my father only said no, now he feels guilty, same thing lot of involvement, lot of money. Lot of stress
16/09/2019, 8:26 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: It's how we take, if that guy wore helmet, your far relative would not have killed
16/09/2019, 8:26 pm - Nagendra: 🤷🏽‍♂ not logical
16/09/2019, 8:27 pm - Nagendra: Suddenly bring rule .. the more time u spend on road the more tax u have to pay.. then people will start going in more speed then more people will die.. then u will tell accidents happening from long time

16/09/2019, 8:32 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: You mean to say, no need to make any rule?

16/09/2019, 8:33 pm - Nagendra: My point is simple.. she can't do trial and error.. her job cannot afford errors.. if she is in doubt better not to do
16/09/2019, 8:34 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: See, people like Barkha and Rajdeep who teja worship, last year when economy was boosting they said it has nothing to do with Modi and his gang, it is related to international dependency

Now they are the ones blaming him for slowdown.
16/09/2019, 8:37 pm - Nagendra: I don't want Barkha Rajdeep and all.. talk about stock market..I have proofs to show our FM did blunder
16/09/2019, 8:40 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: When people are scared with fake news, they do take out market shares. 

Obviously, peddlers won. Someday they will realise.

5 years power has given, BJP or It's FM are not concentrating on only one term govt. They will clear it out if majority of like you are facing issues.

Later it recovered, isn't it ?
16/09/2019, 8:44 pm - Nagendra: Yea but that has lot of impact.. companies will stop getting funds.. investment will not come.. those investors will invest in other countries.. we r losing capital..
16/09/2019, 8:44 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lot lost job in 2007, no one blamed govt, it's the risk they took

16/09/2019, 10:29 pm - Nagendra: HOW SMART IS YOUR RIGHT FOOT? 

This is hysterical. You have to try this. It is absolutely true.
I guess there are some things that the brain cannot handle
You have to try this please, it takes 2 seconds..
I could not believe this! 
It is from an orthopaedic surgeon...............
This will confuse your mind and you will keep
trying over and over again to see if you can
outsmart your foot, but, you can't.  
It is pre-programmed in your brain!

*1. While sitting in chair*
*lift your right foot off the floor and make clockwise circles...*

*2. Now, while doing this, draw the number '6' in the air with your right hand.* 
Your foot will change direction.

To which the man
Matter-of-factly replies, 
"Those are called condoms, son.
Men use them to have safe sex."

"Oh, I see," replied the boy pensively. "I've heard of that in health class at school."

He looks over the display and picks up a package of 3 and asks, Why are there 3 in this package?"

The dad replies, "Those are for *high school boys,* one for Friday, one for Saturday, and one for Sunday.."

"Cool" says the boy... He notices a 6 pack and asks, "Then, who are these for?

"Those are for *college men,*" the dad answers. "TWO for Friday, TWO for Saturday, and TWO for Sunday."

"WOW!" exclaimed the boy,

 "Then, who uses THESE?" he asks, picking up a *12-pack.*

With a sigh and a tear in his eye, the dad replied, "Those are for *married men.* One for January, one for February, one for March....up to December"

21/09/2019, 2:55 pm - Vishak: Depriving study space of kids from underpriveleged families to set up his office. Let the proximity to a library bring some sense to this hateful mind. 

"Bangalore South MP Tejasvi Surya’s decision to set up his office at the public library located in Jayanagar 5th Block has come as a big disappointment to the public, with the MP being accused of snatching a space where kids from underprivileged families gathered to prepare for board examinations.

The building in question belongs to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). While the first and second floor is meant for newspaper reading and public reference, the ground floor was utilised to conduct evening classes to coach children from underprivileged families for SSLC board exams.
21/09/2019, 3:00 pm - Nagendra: Dabba who will close library to make it party office..dabba he is
21/09/2019, 3:01 pm - Nikil Play: It will shifted to first floor

21/09/2019, 3:03 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: It says.

"The library is in the first and second floor. The place where classes are taken has a separate entrance and we are only using an unused area of the building," said one of Surya's staff.

21/09/2019, 9:47 pm - +91 96114 15882: *ಕಣ್ಣೀರನ್ನು ಕಾಣದ ನಗೆ*
(ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿತ್ವ ವಿಕಸನಕ್ಕಾಗಿ)




ಒಂದು ಊರಿನ ಹೊರಗಡೆ ಒಂದು ಸಂಸಾರ ವಾಸವಾಗಿತ್ತು.
ಅವರ ಮನೆಯ ಪಕ್ಕದಲ್ಲೇ ಸ್ಮಶಾನ.
ಈ ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿದ್ದವರು ಮೂವರೇ ಜನ. ತಂದೆ, ತಾಯಿ ಮತ್ತು ಪುಟ್ಟ ಮಗಳು. ಅವಳಿಗೆ ಸುಮಾರು ಆರು ವರ್ಷ ವಯಸ್ಸು. ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕಡು ಬಡತನ. ಮನೆಯೊಳಗೆ ತಿನ್ನಲು ಆಹಾರವಿಲ್ಲ. ಹೊರಗಡೆ ತಿರುಗಾಡುವುದು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲದಷ್ಟು ಹಿಮಪಾತ.
ಅಪ್ಪನ ಕೆಲಸವೇ ವಿಚಿತ್ರ.
ಸ್ಮಶಾನಕ್ಕೆ ಯಾವುದಾದರೂ ಹೆಣ ಬಂದರೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಅವನ ಕೆಲಸ ಪ್ರಾರಂಭ. ಆತ ಮಾಡುವುದು ಹೆಣದ ಅಲಂಕಾರ.
ಆ ದೇಶಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಹೆಣವನ್ನು ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿ ಅಲಂಕಾರ ಮಾಡಿ, ಮರದ ಪೆಟ್ಟಿಗೆಯೊಳಗಿರಿಸಿ ನಂತರ ನೆಲದಲ್ಲಿ ಹೂಳುತ್ತಾರೆ.

ಈತ ಹೆಣದ ಅಲಂಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಪರಿಣಿತ. ಅದಕ್ಕೇ ಜನ ಮೃತದೇಹಗಳನ್ನು ಅಲ್ಲಿಗೆ ತಂದು ಒಪ್ಪಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದರು.
ಈತ ಹೆಣವನ್ನು ಶುದ್ಧವಾಗಿ ತೊಳೆದು, ಮುಲಾಮು ಸವರಿ ನಂತರ ಅವುಗಳಿಗೆ ಒಳ್ಳೆಯ ಪೋಷಾಕು ತೊಡಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದ.
ಮುಖಕ್ಕೆ ವಿಶೇಷವಾದ ಅಲಂಕಾರ ಮಾಡಿ ದೇಹವನ್ನು ಮತ್ತಷ್ಟು ಅಲಂಕಾರ ಮಾಡಿದ ಮರದ ಪೆಟ್ಟಿಗೆಯಲ್ಲಿಟ್ಟು ಸಂಬಂಧಿಕರಿಗೆ ಒಪ್ಪಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದ.
ಈ ಕೆಲಸಕ್ಕೆ ಅವನಿಗೆ ಸುಮಾರು ಮೂರರಿಂದ ನಾಲ್ಕು ತಾಸು ಸಮಯ ತಗಲುತ್ತಿತ್ತು. ಅದಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಅವನಿಗೆ ಒಂದಷ್ಟು ಹಣ ದೊರಕುತ್ತಿತ್ತು. ಅದರಿಂದ ಕೆಲವು ದಿನ ಜೀವನ ಸಾಗುತ್ತಿತ್ತು.

ಹೆಣಗಳು ಬಾರದಿದ್ದ ದಿನ ಬದುಕು ದುರ್ಭರವಾಗುತ್ತಿತ್ತು.
ಮೂವರೂ ಅದೇ ಹಳತಾದ ಬ್ರೆಡ್ ಮತ್ತು ನೀರಿನಂತಹ ಸಾರಿನ ಮೇಲೆಯೇ ಬದುಕುತ್ತಿದ್ದರು.

ಈ ಹುಡುಗಿಗೆ ಅರ್ಥವಾಗಿತ್ತು,
ಹೆಣಗಳು ಬಂದರೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಒಳ್ಳೆಯ ಊಟ ಎಂದು.
ಆಕೆ ಮನೆಯ ಮುಂದೆ ಹೆಣಗಳಿಗಾಗಿ ದಿನಾಲು ಕಾಯ್ದು ನಿಲ್ಲುತ್ತಿದ್ದಳು. ಯಾವುದಾದರೂ ಹೆಣವನ್ನು ಜನ ತಂದರೆ ಅವಳ ಮುಖ ಅರಳುತ್ತಿತ್ತು.
ಹೆಣದ ಹಿಂದಿದ್ದ ಜನರ ದು:ಖ ಅವಳ ಗಮನಕ್ಕೇ ಬರುತ್ತಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಪ್ರತಿ ಬಾರಿ ದೇಹವೊಂದು ಮನೆಯ ಹತ್ತಿರ ಬಂದಾಗ ಅವಳ ಮುಖದಲ್ಲಿ ವಿಚಿತ್ರವಾದ ಸಂತೋಷದ ಛಾಯೆ ಮೂಡುತ್ತಿತ್ತು.

ಒಂದು ದಿನ ಹುಡುಗಿ ಮನೆಯ ಮುಂದೆ ನಿಂತಿದ್ದಾಳೆ. ದೂರದಲ್ಲಿ ಯಾರೋ ದೇಹವನ್ನು ತೆಗೆದುಕೊಂಡು ಬರುತ್ತಿದ್ದ ದೃಶ್ಯ ಕಾಣಿಸಿತು.
ಅವಳ ಮುಖದ ಮೇಲೆ ನಗೆ ತೇಲಿತು. ತಕ್ಷಣ ಅವಳಿಗೆ ನೆನಪಾಯಿತು, ಅಪ್ಪ ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಓಡಿ ಹೋಗಿ ಅಮ್ಮನಿಗೆ ಹೆಣ ಬರುತ್ತಿರುವ ಶುಭಸುದ್ದಿ ತಿಳಿಸಿದಳು.
ಅಮ್ಮ ಹೇಳಿದರು, ಬರಲಿಬಿಡು, ನಿನ್ನ ತಂದೆ ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ಹೊತ್ತಿನಲ್ಲೇ ಬರುತ್ತಾರೆ.

ಜನ ತಂದು ಹೆಣವನ್ನು ಮನೆಯ ಮುಂದೆ ಇಳಿಸಿದರು. ಹುಡುಗಿ ಸಂತೋಷದಿಂದ ಓಡಿಬಂದು ನೋಡಿದರೆ ಅದು ತನ್ನ ತಂದೆಯದೇ ದೇಹ.
ಹುಡುಗಿಯ ಮುಖದ ಮೇಲಿನ ನಗೆ ಮಾಯವಾಗಿ ದು:ಖ ಒತ್ತರಿಸಿ ಬಂದಿತು. ಮೊದಲ ಬಾರಿಗೆ ಹೆಣದ ದೃಶ್ಯ ಆಕೆಗೆ ದು:ಖ ತಂದಿತು.

ಈ ಕಥೆ ನನ್ನ ಮೇಲೆ ಬಹಳ ಪರಿಣಾಮ ಬೀರಿತು. ಮತ್ತೊಬ್ಬರ ದು:ಖಗಳಿಗೆ ಸ್ಪಂದಿಸದೇ ತಮ್ಮ ವೈಯಕ್ತಿಕ ಲಾಭಗಳಿಗಾಗಿ ಜನರನ್ನು ಸುಲಿಯುವ ಭ್ರಷ್ಟ ಜನರು ಕೂಡ ಇದೇ ವರ್ಗಕ್ಕೆ ಸೇರುವಂಥವರು.

ಆ ಹುಡುಗಿ ಹೇಗೆ ಹೆಣದ ಹಿಂದಿದ್ದ ಜನರ ದು:ಖವನ್ನು ಕಾಣದೇ ತನ್ನ ತಂದೆಗೆ ಬರಬಹುದಾದ ಹಣವನ್ನು ಮಾತ್ರ ಅಪೇಕ್ಷಿಸಿ ಸಂತೋಷ ಪಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದಳೋ ಅದೇ ರೀತಿ ಜನರ ಕಷ್ಟಗಳ, ಕಣ್ಣೀರನ್ನು ಕಾಣದೇ ಜನರನ್ನು ಲೂಟಿ ಮಾಡುವ ಭ್ರಷ್ಟರು ಒಂದು ದಿನ ಆ ಹುಡುಗಿ ಎದುರಿಸಿದಂಥ ಆಘಾತವನ್ನು ಎದುರಿಸಲೇಬೇಕೆಂಬುದು ಸತ್ಯ.

ವೈಯಕ್ತಿಕ ಲಾಭಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಪರರ ಕಣ್ಣೀರು ಕಾಣದ ಜನರಿಗೆ ಈ ಶಾಶ್ವತ ಸತ್ಯ ಮೊದಲೇ ಅರ್ಥವಾದರೆ  ಎಷ್ಟು ಒಳ್ಳೆಯದಲ್ಲವೇ?

*ಸ್ನೇಹಿತರೆ ಆದಷ್ಟು ಒಳ್ಳೆಯ ಚಿಂತನೆಗಳನ್ನು ಮಾಡೋಣ ಸಾರ್ಥಕ ಜೀವನ ನಡೆಸೋಣ.*

25/09/2019, 11:45 am - Lola Infosys: Ranitidine the most popular acidity drug...widely available as Rantac, Aciloc, Zinetac, Histac, etc...has been found to contain Cancer causing Chemical(NDMA). As per an estimate every 1 out 3 Indian consumes Ranitidine in form of Rantac, Zinetac, Aciloc, Histac, etc... All the developed countries have alreday initiated the action with sales completely stopped in Canada, Singapore and Baharain. GSK the global leader in sales of Ranitidine has stopped sales following the US-Food and Drug Administration. India Government as usual is slow to react...moreover all the drugs found in all Western countries are majorly of Indian origin, so the news is being suppressed.
Please circulate to as many people possible as some of your loved ones might be at risk of getting Cancer due to Ranitidine.
