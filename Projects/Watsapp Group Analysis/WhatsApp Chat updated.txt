15/07/17, 10:27 AM - Lola Infosys: Once a Bright and Intelligent young man went for an IAS  interview.

He was asked -

Q 1. When did India get Independence?

He answered - The efforts started long back; but could succeed in 1947.

Q 2. Who were the persons, who played important role in this fight for Independence?

Answer - There are many people, who were involved and contributed in this. If I give a name, it will be injustice to others.

Q 3. Do you think, Corruption is the greatest enemy of the country?

Answer - A committee is investigating in this matter. I can give a correct reply to this only after seeing the report.

The Interview Board was impressed by his original ideas. They asked him to wait outside; but also advised him not to reveal the questions, as they may ask the same questions to other candidates also.

When the young man went out of the room, Sardar inquired about the questions asked. The young man said that he had promised the interview board not to disclose the questions.

But, Sardar found a way out. "Tell me the answer you gave."

The young man, thought it to be okay, as he was not going back on his words of "not disclosing the QUESTIONS". So he gave him the three answer which Sardar quickly learnt by heart.

When Sardar went in for interview, this is what happened.

Q 1. When were you born?

Sardar:- The efforts started long back, but could succeed in 1947.

Interviewers got confused...they asked next question.

Q 2. What is your father's name?

Sardar :- There are many people, who were involved and contributed in this. If I give a name, it will be injustice to others.

The board members were shocked at the reply..they said.

Q 3. Are you mad?

Sardar :- A committee is investigating in this matter. I can give a correct reply to this only after seeing the report.

In our life, problems may go from *Haywards 2000* to *Haywards 5000,* but we must take them as a *Royal Challenge*  otherwise people will call us *Old Monk* and put a *Black Label* on our name. So we must learn from *Teachers* to fight like *Jack Daniel,* live like a *Bagpiper,* walk like *Johny Walker,* work till *8 PM* & think like *Director Special.* Catch the ideas like *Kingfisher* and *Knockout* all the problems. Then life will be *Imperial* & we will become *Aristocrat* & there will be value for our *Signature*🍻

When unlimited calls and data are available only in Rs. 399/-

Then why members of Parliament are getting Rs. 15000/- as telephone allowance ?

245 Members of Rajya Sabha
545 Members of Lok Sabha
790 members of parliament multiplied by Rs 15000/- thats 
Rs.11,850,000/- Only wastage of our tax money.
Think and make this post viral till it reaches our PM who is advising citizens to 
surrender LPG subsidy.

And Love I laugh to scorn; 
And lust of fame was but a dream 
That vanish’d with the morn; 
And if I pray, the only prayer 
That moves my lips for me 
Is, “Leave the heart that now I bear, 
And give me liberty!” 
Yes, as my swift days near their goal, 
’Tis all that I implore: 
In life and death a chainless soul,
With courage to endure.

At the Wall of Kindness, one can leave gently used clothes, shoes, books, blankets, toys & more, which in turn can be picked up by the people in need of them. You can find this symbol of camaraderie adjacent to the Sri Ganesh HPCL Petrol Pump at Dasappa Circle, JLB Road, #Mysuru.

ಇದನ್ನು ಉಪಯೋಗಿಸಿದ ಅನೇಕರು ಕೇವಲ ಎರಡೇ ದಿನಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಆಸ್ಪತ್ರೆಯಿಂದ ಹೊರಬಂದಿರುವುದು ಸಮಾಧಾನದ ಸಂಗತಿ.

As per new petroleum rules, there is no need to bother about different states. Now there are facilities to get same fuel at different price in same fuel dispenser. Who knows... Who cares...

* Benefits of daily fuel price revision - no body knows the actual price.

18/08/17, 10:58 AM - Theja: RESIGNATION EMAIL RECEIVED FROM THE VISHAL SIKKA, MD AND CEO BY THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS ON August 18, 2017.
Dear Board Colleagues,
Over the last few days, since our earlier call, I've met Sesh several times, talked to you individually
at length, and spent time thinking things thru with Vandana. During this time, one of our
employees, Sandeep Karamongikar, died in his sleep, likely of a massive heart attack. He was
working on the chatbot frontend in Nia. Also over the weekend, in possibly the greatest
demonstration of AI capability ever, a bot built by the researchers at OpenAI (yes, that OpenAI),
defeated the world's best players of DOTA2, a multiplayer online video game, a game where the
bot learned to play entirely from scratch. Further demonstrating that the force to automate
routine, even advanced, activities is an unstoppable and exponential one. And the Charlottesville
incident here in the US demonstrated once again the power of words and silences to cause real
damage, or to heal.
After much reflection, I have concluded that it is indeed time for me to leave my current positions
as MD and CEO, and I have communicated my resignation to Sesh.
I will be working closely with Sesh, Ravi, Pravin, with all of you, and the senior management team
to plan out the details and the timelines to ensure a smooth transition and in the meantime,
continue our work without disruption, and ensuring that we protect our company, the
employees, the clients, and the interests of every shareholder. You can count on my commitment
to this.
I came here to help navigate the company through what I saw as a massive transformation
opportunity, to transform our company and restore strong profitable growth, as well as help 
transform the business of our customers. I came to do this with the power of technology, given
my experiences with similar transformations, my background in AI, and the structural changes
that I saw happening in the IT services industry. This needed new skills, new thinking, new
initiatives, and a transformation in the culture, from a cost-oriented value delivery, to
entrepreneurship oriented value delivery. You have heard me articulate this many times before.
This type of a transformation has always been a passion for me, indeed I took this job for this
reason. We have achieved much in the last 3+ years, and for sure we can all be proud of the
powerful seeds of transformation that have already been sowed. No one anticipated the
additional headwinds like the geo-political disruptions (Brexit, Trump, visa etc.) that made this
transformation even more challenging, but also rewarding. But, the distractions that we have
seen, the constant drumbeat of the same issues over and over again, while ignoring and
undermining the good work that has been done, take the excitement and passion out of this
amazing journey. Over the last many months and quarters, we have all been besieged by false,
baseless, malicious and increasingly personal attacks. Allegations that have been repeatedly
proven false and baseless by multiple, independent investigations. But despite this, the attacks
continue, and worse still, amplified by the very people from whom we all expected the most
steadfast support in this great transformation. This continuous drumbeat of distractions and
negativity over the last several months/quarters, inhibits our ability to make positive change and
stay focused on value creation. Addressing the noise by itself is damaging; hundreds of hours of
my own time has gone into this recently. But the structural challenges this engenders within the
organization, has a very damaging effect on our ability to carry out any kind of a transformation,
especially one that is as fundamental as transforming from a cost-oriented to an innovationoriented
value delivery to clients.
Therefore, I have come to this moment and the end of this journey. I hope that it gives everyone
a chance to reflect, and give the transformation effort another big push and move the company
forward rapidly to build its future, to build upon the foundation that we have laid over these past
3 years. If these types of attacks continue, I hope each of you will continue to be the voice of
fairness and reason - providing the active, emphatic and unequivocal support that the company, 
the management, the employees, and all of the stakeholders and friends of the company need
in order to succeed. Since the board deeply believes in the cause we have started, I will be happy
to support all of you to achieve a smooth transition, and serve as your Executive Vice Chair as
discussed.
I would like to thank each one of you, my dear colleagues, my friends and mentors, and look
forward to working with you to close this chapter and open a great new one for all of us.
Best,
V

20/08/17, 3:05 PM - Lola Infosys: Modi walked into a bar around 9:58 pm. He sat down next to Rahul at the bar and stared up at the TV.

The 10 pm news was coming on. The news crew was covering the story of a man on the ledge of a large building preparing to jump.

Rahul looked at Modi and said, "Do you think he will jump ?"

Modi said, "You know, I bet he will jump."

Rahul replied, "Well, I bet he won't."

Modi placed Rs. 1000 on the bar and said, "You're on !"

Just as Rahul placed his money on the bar, the guy on the ledge jumped off the building, falling to his death.

Rahul was very upset, but willingly handed his Rs.1000 to Modi,  saying, "Fair is fair. Here's your money."

Modi replied, "I can't take your money. I saw this earlier on the 5 pm news, and so I knew he would jump."

Rahul replied, "I did too, but didn't think he would do it again."

This time Modi took the money.

A curious person who was observing this price competition, advises the Gujju, 'brother you can't compete with a big store for a long' and stop this price competition for the Ghee!

23/08/17, 1:14 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Story - Sex for $ 20 😉
    
Believe it or not, it's a true story..

On their wedding night, the young bride approached her new husband and asked for $20.00 for their first lovemaking encounter.

In his highly aroused state, her husband readily agreed.

This scenario was repeated each time they made love, for more than 30 years, with him thinking that it was a cute way for her to afford new clothes and other incidentals that she needed.

Arriving home around noon one day, she was surprised to find her husband in a very drunken state.

During the next few minutes, he explained that his employer was going through a process of corporate downsizing, and he had been let go.

It was unlikely that at the age of 59, he'd be able to find another job.

Calmly, his wife handed him a bank book which showed more than thirty years of steady deposits and interest totaling nearly $1 million.

Then she showed him certificates of deposits issued by the bank which were worth over $2 million.

She explained that she had 'charged' him for sex, and these were the results of her savings and investments.

The husband was so astounded he could barely speak.

Finally he found his voice and blurted out, 'If I'd had any idea what you were doing, I would have had sex only with you.'

That's when she shot him..🔫
 
You know, men just don't know when to keep their mouth shut, specially when drunk..!😜💣🔫🔪
 Keep 😶😶😶

Its the husband's funeral tommorrow.

27/09/17, 4:31 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: George went to the doctor's office to ask for a double dose of Viagra.

The doctor told him that he couldn't allow him a double dose.

"Why not?' asked 

"Because it's not safe,' replied the doctor

"But I need it really bad,' said George 

"Well, why do you need it so badly?' asked the doctor.

George answered,
 "My girlfriend is coming into town on Friday; 
my ex-wife will be here on Saturday; 
and my wife is coming home on Sunday. 

Can't you see? I must have a double dose."

The doctor finally relented saying, "Okay, I'll give it to you, but you have to come in on Monday morning so that I can check you to see if there are any bad side effects."

On Monday, George dragged himself in to the doctor's office, his right arm in a sling.

The doctor asked, "What happened to you?

George said, "No one showed up."😂😁👍

28/09/17, 8:07 AM - Lola Infosys: I asked my friend's son what he wanted to be when he grows up. He said he wanted to be Prime Minister some day.
Both of his parents, liberal leftists, were standing there, so I asked him, 'If you were Prime Minister, what would be the first thing you would do?'
He replied, 'I'd give food and houses to all the homeless people.' His parents beamed with pride.
'Wow...what a worthy goal.' I told him. 'But you don't have to wait until you're Prime Minister to do that. You can come over to my house and mow the lawn, pull weeds, and sweep my yard, and I'll pay you Rs.500. Then I'll take you over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out, and you can give him the same 500 rupee note for food and new set of clothes .'
He thought that over for a few seconds, then he looked me straight in the eyes and asked, ' Why doesn't the homeless guy come over and do the work, and you can just pay him Rs.500?'
I said, 'Welcome to the Rightist fold.'
His parents still aren't speaking to me...

29/09/17, 8:55 AM - Lola Infosys: Good read:

● At 20 years "foreign country" and "hometown" is the same. (No matter where you are, you can always adapt) 

● At 30 years, "night time" and "daytime" is the same. (A few days of no sleep, does not matter) 

● At 40 years, "highly educated" and  "lowly educated" is the same. (Lowly educated persons, may even earn more money) 

● At 50 years, "beauty" and "ugly" is the same. (No matter how pretty you are, at this age, wrinkles, dark spots, etc. start to appear.) 

● At 60 years, "high official" and "low official" are the same. (After retirement, their status are the same)

● At 70 years, "big house" and "small house" is the same. (Joints degeneration,  cannot walk, only require a little space .)

● At 80 years, "have money" and "no money" is the same. (Even when you spend money, you won't be able to spend much) 

● At 90 years old, being "man" and "woman" is the same. 

● At 100 years, "Sleeping" and "waking up" is the same. (After you wake up, you still don't know what to do) 

Take life easy, there are no mysteries to be solved. 
In the long run, we'll all be the same 🙏🙏

30/09/17, 8:28 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I loved the concept:
There are four yugas widely accepted in Hinduism. They are :
1. Satya yug
2. Treta yug (Ramayana)
3. Dwapara yug(Mahabharata)
4. Kal yug(Present)

In Satya yug, the fight was between two worlds (Devalok & Asuralok). Asuralok being the evil, was a different WORLD.

In Treta yug, the fight was between Rama and Ravana. Both rulers from two different COUNTRIES.

In Dwapara yug, the fight was between Pandavas and Kauravas. Both good and evil from the SAME FAMILY.

Kindly note how the evil is getting closer. For example, from a DIFFERENT WORLD to a DIFFERENT COUNTRY to the SAME FAMILY.

Now, know where is the evil in Kaliyug???

It is inside us. Both GOOD AND EVIL LIVE WITHIN. The battle is within us. Who will we give victory to, our inner goodness or the evil within??

Think, identify and fight. 👍Happy Navaratri 🙏

1) *And they burned him*: The Indian Express
 
2) Was Ram required to go down all the way to Lanka to pick a fight? Where is our hospitality, our culture? Why was Ravana being terrorized: *The Hindu*

3) India is not safe for women: *BBC*

4) Do we want an India where a King burns down an entire empire to secure his wife? Are we lacking empathy: *Rajdeep Sardesai*

5) An Open Letter to Ram; Am I going to lose my Wife in his Rajya: *Ravish Kumar*

6) Did Ram send Hanuman and a force of monkeys to Lanka against their will? Isn’t this cruelty: *PETA*

7) The devotees of Ram had secured all the plum postings and social benefits in the country, and hence, the kidnapping of Sita is justified: *Barkha Dutt*

8. Ravana Killed! A new age for Saffron Terror: *Sagarika Ghose*

9) Ayodhya Diaries. How Truth about Ram and Sita was Hidden and Ravana was Framed: *Rana Ayyub*

10) Ravana did not kidnap Sita, Ram’s war did: *JNU Intellectuals*

11) I toured Ayodhya and I realized Ram’s development model had failed: *Rahul Gandhi*

12) In this audacious mêlée of men beholding to avenge their own perspectives of right, as a populous, have we been smitten by the adoration for war in an unprincipled world: *Shashi Tharoor*

13) Ravana can come to my kingdom, we will ensure his safety: *Arvind Kejriwal*

09/10/17, 8:15 AM - Nagendra: Good calculation.
On a bank deposit of Rs. 2000/- for one year, what you get is Rs. 160/- @ 8% interest.

On a bank loan of Rs. 2000/- for one year, what you pay is Rs. 260/- @ 13% interest.

But when you eat food for same Rs. 2000/- you pay Rs. 360/- @ 18% to Government!!!
09/10/17, 8:54 AM - Vishak: Still bhakts are blind😆
09/10/17, 8:55 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Panda still wants India to be ruled by Dumbs like Gandhi family.🤦🏼‍♂
09/10/17, 8:56 AM - Vishak: No way but this government I'd also no better
09/10/17, 8:57 AM - Vishak: Dude tax is something everyone has to pay
09/10/17, 8:57 AM - Vishak: Did u c the report of demonitisation
09/10/17, 8:57 AM - Vishak: It's an epic failure
09/10/17, 8:58 AM - Vishak: Same with GST
09/10/17, 8:58 AM - Vishak: Both were good ideas but implementation is worse
09/10/17, 9:01 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Implementation is because lot of people don't want to lose their black money, 
Central government printed billions of 2k notes before the demonistisation but it never reached people, and it's because the corrupt
09/10/17, 9:01 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Its not an epic failure, lot of people secured,
09/10/17, 9:01 AM - Vishak: Dude according RBI is failure
09/10/17, 9:01 AM - Vishak: U can assume anything
09/10/17, 9:02 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lol, tell me how u were bringing the change ? In the vast country
09/10/17, 9:04 AM - Nagendra: Kill everyone.. let there be new civilization
09/10/17, 9:06 AM - Vishak: U bring change not by doing it in one shot
09/10/17, 9:07 AM - Vishak: For example u don't Know to clean ur room
09/10/17, 9:07 AM - Vishak: If ur parents tell clean the entire home in 1 day it would be easy
09/10/17, 9:08 AM - Vishak: Or tell clean ur room first in 2 hours then take break . Next u clean other 2 more rooms, next day complete entire home
09/10/17, 9:08 AM - Vishak: There will be learning
09/10/17, 9:08 AM - Vishak: One by one
09/10/17, 9:09 AM - Nagendra: Throw everything out of room.. bring in things which r needed n place it properly
09/10/17, 9:09 AM - Vishak: 😑
09/10/17, 9:13 AM - Lola Infosys: 😂
09/10/17, 9:14 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Panda, u r way is like before the surgical strike on Pakistan, let's inform all the terrorists to hideaway
09/10/17, 9:14 AM - Lola Infosys: Demo was done by Congress also earlier. They also failed. So point in relating this only to modi rule. Every rule has failures due to corruption
09/10/17, 9:14 AM - Lola Infosys: No point*
09/10/17, 9:15 AM - Vishak: Fully different issue
09/10/17, 9:15 AM - Lola Infosys: Earlier also tax was high. Ppl are saying like gst is the only time tax is high
09/10/17, 9:16 AM - Vishak: Wat high man chosen
09/10/17, 9:16 AM - Vishak: 18% 28%
09/10/17, 9:16 AM - Vishak: It was never that much
09/10/17, 9:17 AM - Vishak: Dude I don't mind any government is ter
09/10/17, 9:17 AM - Lola Infosys: For our ancestors 10% was high. Can't compare old to New
09/10/17, 9:17 AM - Vishak: I don't want to give so much money for government
09/10/17, 9:17 AM - Vishak: End of the day they don't give back anything
09/10/17, 9:17 AM - Lola Infosys: I agree it's not great now. But saying only modi is failure is wrong
09/10/17, 9:18 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: During Indira Gandhi rule, tax was 80% search in Google dumb
09/10/17, 9:18 AM - Lola Infosys: 50yrs of corruption can't be made proper in 5yrs
09/10/17, 9:18 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: U were giving more earlier, just match some old bill to new GST
09/10/17, 9:19 AM - Vishak: Dono y ppl blindly support
09/10/17, 9:19 AM - Vishak: Dude it's different India tat time
09/10/17, 9:19 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Yeah I'm thinking the same, don't why people blindly believe congress
09/10/17, 9:19 AM - Vishak: I mean I not saying Congress was good
09/10/17, 9:19 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Different India different time ??
09/10/17, 9:19 AM - Vishak: Ya
09/10/17, 9:20 AM - Vishak: No fdi and all
09/10/17, 9:20 AM - Lola Infosys: Now also it's different. Don't compare to earlier times
09/10/17, 9:20 AM - Vishak: Dude demonitisation was unnecessary
09/10/17, 9:21 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: UPA fucked us 50 years, some guy bringing change now and no one supports, 
All Indians wants PM like ManMohan
09/10/17, 9:21 AM - Vishak: GST not implemented properly
09/10/17, 9:21 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lo, how will you forcibly take black money then
09/10/17, 9:22 AM - Vishak: Dude I dono everyone is like Congress vs bjp
09/10/17, 9:22 AM - Lola Infosys: It was done by Congress first. Why don't you start complaining that first and then come to Modi's demonization later
09/10/17, 9:22 AM - Vishak: Dude when?
09/10/17, 9:22 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Everything is planned and Implemented, it's not talking off properly its because of the corrupts
09/10/17, 9:22 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Google Dude

09/10/17, 9:23 AM - Vishak: Wtf
09/10/17, 9:23 AM - Lola Infosys: He wants raga to rule
09/10/17, 9:24 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Only difference was population, compare to now and then
09/10/17, 9:24 AM - Vishak: I dono how u bhakts always support him
09/10/17, 9:24 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I don't know why you don't see any change
09/10/17, 9:25 AM - Lola Infosys: Every change has good n bad things, n failures due to ppl not accepting change or due to corruption. But if it was brought keeping in mind for good things, then support it. These big changes can't be completed in 5yrs
09/10/17, 9:25 AM - Vishak: I see fucked up change
09/10/17, 9:25 AM - Lola Infosys: Not supporting only coz it's modi. Even if Kejriwal or raga came up with this, all would have said negatives
09/10/17, 9:25 AM - Lola Infosys: It takes time

CNN
Reasons for lower GDP Growth during the past quarter:

Imagine that you are appointed a Principal/Director of a college which is notorious for cheating and poor quality of education.

You find that most students cheat during the examination with the support of the teachers and do quite well in exams. The result of the college has been always more than 90% in recent years.

You are a person with principles and hence you decide to totally eliminate cheating from the examination. You install CCTV cameras in all examination halls and take actions against the students and the teachers who are found engaged in cheating.

The result is that cheating is totally stopped in examinations.

However, the performance of your college dips drastically and less than 50% students pass. This has been a bad performance in recent times.

You now face flak from all sides.

Students are angry because they failed due to your strictness.

Teachers are angry because their track record got spoiled because of you.

Trustees of college are angry because the result of their college has taken a beating under your charge.

This is what is happening in India right now.
But someone had to cleanup the mess!!

21/10/17, 5:58 AM - Nagendra: Betta anyone? In next 30 mins
21/10/17, 7:51 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Don’t be Apologetic about Diwali - Enjoy it 

In my city of Bengaluru alone - 4 lakhs Animals are Killed on Eid which includes 10000 Large animals like Cattle and Camels 
It generates 300 tonnes of animal waste which is just buried in pits near Kogilu on the city outskirts 
For 14 lakh Muslims in Bengaluru - 4 lakh Animals killed 
Even if one Animal weighs 10 kg then can an average person eat 3 kg meat on single day ?
And mind you this includes kids and infants also 
So most of the meat goes waste though people might claim we give it to poor 

If you conflate this number to whole of India then imagine the number of Animals killed on the single day ?
For 200 millon it must be at least 20 millon Animals 
And 200 millon kgs of Meat and staggering 8 billon kgs of Green House gases or Carbon dioxide and we are not even calculating the lakhs of tonnes of bio waste generated  

And now conflate this number to the whole world 
It is 200 millon Animals 80 billon kgs of CO2 

Now let us come to ThanksGiving in USA - 45 million Turkeys are killed 

Christmas in US - 25 million Turkeys are killed 

In US 30 million trees are chopped off every year to make Christmas Tree 
Which is huge pollution 
And 50 million artificial trees are used which is made of plastic and is even more polluting 
On Independence Day July 4th USA uses 1 billion Worth of fire crackers which is 5 times more than what India uses in an whole year 
Chinese use more times more firecrackers on Chinese New Year alone that what US does on July 4
World wide on New year billions Worth Fire crackers are used 
Hindu festivals are the only Eco Friendly festivals on Earth 
As most of Hindus eat only Vegetarian food on festivals 
Other wise every other religion the meat is the most important item on a festival or any celebration 

But when it comes to narrative it is only hindu festivals which are being maligned as polluting 
Holi - Water Pollution so Waterless Holi
Ganesh - Sea or River Pollution So Green Ganesh 
Dussehra - Riots/ sexual abuse so don’t go dandia or no Durga Idol immersion 
Diwali - Air Pollution so no fire crackers 
Have you seen any one raising topic of Pollution on Christmas New year or Eid ?
Has anyone campaigned for Veg Xmas or Green New Year or No killing on Eid ?
So don’t let breaking India forces take the fun out of Diwali 
Let the festivals of lights 
Hindu festivals are green by nature as Hindus worship nature and all tHe festivals are born out of nature worship
PS - The most comprehensive report on Delhi Pollution by IIT Kharagpur has not included Fire crackers in the report 
Road Dust, Concrete batching, Vehicles, Coal tandoors, Crop burning, industries are responsible for Delhi air pollution

28/10/17, 10:30 PM - Lola Infosys: Do you fart in bed ?
This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years, the only friction in their marriage was the husband’s habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke the noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.
Every morning
she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, “Honey you were right… all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.” “What do you mean?” asked his wife. “Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened, but by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers. I think I got most of them back in……......

A lady gave some of her old sarees to her maid n said,.. "Take these, & use them,.. They are of good quality & I don't wanna throw them, just that they are old, you use them all..!!" 

After 3 days, maid returned all the old sarees to the lady & said
"Madam, please take back your clothes... Because, your husband thinks I'm you, & ignores ME all the time,.. 
& I wonder why, from past 3 days, your neighbours Sharmaji, Guptaji, & Mishra ji are coming & hugging me from behind..!! 😛😜😜😛😜😛

A Policeman came & said: Mam u r in "NO" fishing Zone.

She replied: "I am reading not fishing."

The policeman said: "But u have all equipment & u might start anytime."

The woman shouted back: "Im not fishing here and now u r sexually harassing me."

Shocked policeman replied: "I am not doing anything!"

She smiled: "You have all equipment & might start

30/10/17, 5:19 PM - Anni jss: Making a baby. This is hilarious!!!

There is not one dirty word in it, and it is funny!-- 

The Saxenas were unable to conceive children and decided to use a surrogate father to start their family. On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Saxena kissed his wife goodbye and said,!

'Well, I'm off now. The man should be here soon.' 

Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.

'Good morning, Ma'am', he said, 'I've come to...' 

'Oh, no need to explain,' Mrs. Saxena cut in, embarrassed, 'I've been expecting you.' 

'Have you really?' said the photographer. 'Well, that's good. Did you know babies are my speciality?' 

'Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat !'

After a moment she asked, blushing, 'Well, where do we start?' 

'Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there.' 

'Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work out for Harish and me!' 

'Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.' 

'My God, that's a lot!', gasped Mrs. Saxena. 

'Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be In and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.' 

'Don't I know it,' said Mrs. Saxena quietly. 

The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. 'This was done on the top of a bus,' he said. 

'Oh, my Gosh!' Mrs. Saxena exclaimed, grasping at her throat. 

'And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with.' 

'She was difficult?' asked Mrs. Saxena. 

'Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look' 

'Four and five deep?' said Mrs. Saxena, her eyes wide with amazement. 

'Yes', the photographer replied. 'And! for more than three hours, too.”

“The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in.' 

Mrs. Saxena leaned forward. 'Do you mean they actually chewed on your, uh...equipment?' 

'It's true, Ma'am, yes.. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.' 

'Tripod?' 

'Oh yes, Ma'am. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's too big to be held in the hand very long.' 

Mrs. Saxena fainted ! ! !

03/11/17, 9:01 AM - Lola Infosys: After Donald Trump, the world is wondering if it is the blonde men, not women, who are actually a bit dumber. They collected these true stories of blonde men 

---------------------

A blonde man is in the bathroom and his wife shouts: "Did you find the shampoo?"

He answers, "Yes, but I'm not sure what to do... it's for dry hair, and I've already wet mine."

-----------------------

A blonde man sees a letter lying on his doormat. It says on the envelope "DO NOT BEND."

He spends the next 2 hours trying to figure out how to pick it up.

----------------------

A blonde man shouts frantically into the phone, "My wife is pregnant and her contractions are only two minutes apart!"

"Is this her First Child?" asks the Doctor.

"No!" he shouts, "this is her husband!"

-----------------------

A blonde man is in jail, the guard looks in his cell and sees him hanging by his feet.

"Just WHAT are you doing?" he asks.

"Hanging myself," the blonde replies.

"The rope should be around your neck," says the guard.

"I tried that," he replies, "but then I couldn't breathe."

----------------------

An Italian tourist asks a blonde man: "Why do scuba divers always fall backwards off their boats?"

To which the blonde man replies: "Dude, If they fell forward, they'd still be in the boat."

---------------------

A friend told the blonde man: "Christmas is on a Friday this year."

The blonde man then said, "Let's hope it's not the 13th."

---------------------

Two blonde men find three grenades, and they decide to take them to a police station.

One asked: "What if one explodes before we get there?"

The other says: "We'll lie and say we only found two."

---------------------

A woman phoned her blonde neighbor man and said: "Close your curtains the next time you and your wife are intimate. The whole street was watching and laughing at YOU yesterday."

To which the blonde man replied: "Well the joke's on ALL OF YOU because I wasn't even at home yesterday !"

07/11/17, 11:54 PM - Anni jss: *Have you ever read these Western philosophers*
----------------------------------------------

1. *Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910)*

"Hindus and Hindutva will one day rule the world, because this is a combination of knowledge and wisdom".

2. *Herbert Wells (1846 - 1946):*

"Until the effectiveness of Hindutva is restored, how many generations will suffer atrocities and life will be cut off, then one day the entire world will be attracted to it, on that day there will be Dilshad and on that day the world will be inhabited.

3. *Albert Einstein (1879-1955):*

"I understand that through his intelligence and awareness he did that which the Jews could not do. In Hinduism it is the power that can lead to peace."

4. *Huston Smith (1919):*

"The faith which is upon us and this is better than us in the world, then it is Hindutva. If we open our hearts and minds for it, then it will be good for us".

5. *Michael Nostradamus (1503 - 1566):*

"Hindutva will become the ruler religion in Europe, but the famous city of Europe will become the Hindu capital".

6. *Bertrand Russell (1872 - 1970):*

"I read Hinduism and realized that it is for the religion of all the world and all mankind." Hindutva will spread throughout Europe and in Europe, big thinkers of Hinduism will emerge. One day it will come that Hindus will be the real stimulus of the world. ".

7. *Gosta Lobon (1841 - 1931):*

"Hindus speak of peace and reconciliation. I invite Christians to appreciate the faith of reform."

8. *Bernard Shaw (1856 - 1950):*

"The entire world will accept Hindu religion one day and if it can not even accept the real name it will accept it by name only." West will accept Hindutva one day and Hindu will be the religion of those who have studied in the world ".

9. *Johann Geith (1749 - 1832):*

"We all have to accept Hinduism now or later and this is the real religion. If I say no to Hindu, I will not feel bad, I accept this right thing."

*Plz share to all ur links*

09/11/17, 8:56 AM - Vishak: A couple went to a Sex Therapist office at a BIG Corporate Hospital.

The doctor asked,"What can I do for you?"

The man said ,"something is not right., Will you watch us having sex, for your expert analysis?"

The doctor looked puzzled, 🙄 but agreed.

When the couple finished, the doctor said,"There's nothing wrong with the way you have intercourse,"and charged them Rs.1300.

This happened several weeks in a row. The couple would make an appointment, have intercourse with no problems, pay the doctor and then leave.

Finally one day the doctor asked,"exactly what are you trying to find out? You are paying me so much.."


The man said, ."We're not trying to find out anything. She's married and we can't go to her house, I'm married and we can't go to my house." 

The Oberoi charges Rs. 15000,

Taj charges Rs.14000 ,

Le Meridian charges Rs.12500.

We do it here for Rs.1300,

Punch line is yet to come..........

Use Headphone/Earphone and enjoy..

22/11/17, 1:05 PM - Lola Infosys: An Indian goes to Australia and goes to Woolworths (The largest supermarket store in Australia).
He finds cat food at special prices. He picks a dozen cans of cat food and goes to
check out.

The Manager gets suspicious. He thinks that this guy cannot have a cat and will
probably feed cat food to his kids. He asks the Indian to show him his cat before he
could let him have cat food. The Indian goes home and returns with a cat and gets
to buy the cat food.

One week later the Indian finds dog food at special prices. He picks a dozen cans of
dog food and goes to check out.

The Manager again gets suspicious. He thinks that this guy has a cat but he cannot
have a dog and he will probably feed dog food to his kids. He asks the Indian to bring
and show him the dog before he can let him have dog food.

The Indian goes home and returns with a dog. He gets to buy the dog food.

The following week later the Indian comes to Woolworths with a bag. He asks the
manager to put his hand in the bag.

The Manager puts his hand in the bag, feels some thing slimy and immediately takes it
out.

He shouted at the Indian, "What the F*** is this? Is this shit, you Idiot?"

The Indian calmly replies, "Yes, and I want to buy toilet paper.."

A Nigerian mother was lucky enough to see her 3 daughters get married the same year, so she called them after the wedding and told them

 "Dont forget to text me your first night experience and text it in code" 

So....... after a week, the 1st daughter texted 

"NESCAFE" 

and the next week the 2nd daughter text 

"BENSON" 

the mother being an intelligent woman went to get a Nescafe tin and read the label 

"fantastic till the last drop"

 went to her husband's pack of Benson cigarette and read 
"Extra long, king size" 

she smiled and said "not bad for their ages". 

After the next week, the 3rd daughter texted 

"NAIROBI to MOMBASA", 

the mother then called Kenya airways helpdesk to enquire about their Nairo-Mombasa flight and they replied 

"it's 3times daily, 7days a week, and the flight duration is  75mins". 

The mother fell down and shouted. 

"igweeeeeeeee!!! This one will  kill my daughter ooooooooo!...............

Dont laugh alone, pass it on.

29/11/17, 7:58 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Don't compare DC and Marvel
29/11/17, 7:58 PM - Vishak: Not comics wise
29/11/17, 7:58 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Story always similar, screenplay is fun.
29/11/17, 7:58 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Marvel is fun, DC is serious
29/11/17, 7:58 PM - Lola Infosys: Can't compare
29/11/17, 7:59 PM - Vishak: But dono movie ppl r making it look like marvel better than DC
29/11/17, 7:59 PM - Lola Infosys: Marvel actually doing shit. Not having full rights to many characters n giving it to Sony, fox n all.. like x men , f4, till recent spider man
29/11/17, 7:59 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: If you look at closely, all stories are same only character is different
29/11/17, 8:00 PM - Lola Infosys: All comic books are same. Hero's win
29/11/17, 8:00 PM - Vishak: No way

29/11/17, 8:01 PM - Vishak: It's more about the journey
29/11/17, 8:01 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: In Both DC and MARVEL
29/11/17, 8:01 PM - Lola Infosys: True
29/11/17, 8:01 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Nothing man, its little fun ashte, concept wise they are losing it.
29/11/17, 8:02 PM - Vishak: It's interesting man how they connect all stories
29/11/17, 8:02 PM - Vishak: Ppl even like villian
29/11/17, 8:02 PM - Lola Infosys: Comics are supposed to be like that.. same story overall. But characters n concepts change
29/11/17, 8:02 PM - Vishak: Joker punisher
29/11/17, 8:02 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Nothing is there, that's what I'm sick of, same story always. Simply coming big and making money big
29/11/17, 8:02 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Yeah
29/11/17, 8:03 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Only because Nolan

29/11/17, 8:08 PM - Vishak: I know nobody makes movie on novels
29/11/17, 8:08 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: In India only
29/11/17, 8:08 PM - Lola Infosys: Main thing is marvel dc is supposed to be comics for kids , n characters are based on imagination. So concept ppl like. Other English hindi Kannada movies tend to give powers for normal humans. So less ppl like it

It is said to be the most advanced Gyro-Stabilized camera system in the world. Filmed from a helicopter with a crew flying from Kathmandu at 4,600 to 24,000 ft.

02/12/17, 12:35 PM - Vishak: The district administration had planned to host the festival from December 23 to January 1. As part of the festival programme, there will be 67 activities, including a palace flower show, a cake festival, cultural programmes, heritage bicycle ride, makkal habba, 3D mapping on Mysuru Palace and the screening of a movie in the open.
At the open movie screening, the public can watch a movie on a huge screen, by sitting inside their vehicles or on their two-wheelers. The authorities are discussing on the list of movies which are to be screened

A flower show, having a large collection of flowers and ornamental plants, will be organized at the Mysuru palace premises. More than 10,000 flowering and ornamental plants will be on display.

Similarly, a day-long 'Open Street Festival' will be organized at D Devaraja Urs road, the commercial hub of the city. The festival which was organized during the Dasara festivities by the tourism department, for the first time in Mysuru city, got a big thumbs-up from locals as well as tourists. The busy road will be made traffic-free on the occasion, and will allow the public to enjoy shopping, playing games and eating and drinking from food stalls on the stretch with leisure.

04/12/17, 10:03 PM - Vishak: ನನ್ನ ಒಬ್ಬ ಸ್ನೇಹಿತನ ಸಂದೇಶ ವಾಟ್ಸಪ್ ಗ್ರೂಪಿನಲ್ಲಿ....

ನಾನು ಕೆಲವು ತಮಿಳರ ವಾಟ್ಸಾಪು ಗುಂಪುಗಳಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಇದ್ದೇನೆ.
ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರ ಗುಂಪುಗಳಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಇದ್ದೇನೆ...ಅಲ್ಲಿನ ಚರ್ಚಾ ವಿಶಯಗಳು ಹೀಗಿವೆ..

ತಮಿಳರ ಗುಂಪುಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆಯುವ ಚರ್ಚೆಗಳು ..
೧. ತಮಿಳರ ಉದ್ಯೋಗ, ನೀಟ್ ಪರೀಕ್ಷಾ ವ್ಯವಸ್ತೆ, ಜಲಗಲಿಕಟ್ಟು 
೨. ತಮಿಳು ಸಿನಿಮಾಗಳು
೩. ಹೊರದೇಶದ ತಮಿಳರ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಗಳು
೪. ತಮಿಳು ಸಾಹಿತ್ಯ 
೫. ತಮಿಳು ನಾಡಿನ ರಾಜಕೀಯ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಗಳು.
ಇತ್ಯಾದಿ..

ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರ ಗುಂಪುಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆಯುವ ಚರ್ಚೆಗಳು 
೧. ಮೋದಿಯ ಮೋಡಿ
೨. ಇಂದು ಅಮಿತ್ ಶಾ ಏನು ಹೇಳಿದರು.
೩. ಗಾಂಧಿಯನ್ನು ಕೊಂದದ್ದು ಏಕೆ ಸರಿ
೪. ನಹರೂ ಮಾಡಿದ ಹಿಂದೂ ವಿರೋಧಿ ಕೆಲಸಗಳು.
೫. ವಿರಾಟ್ ಹಿಂದೂ ಸಮಾವೇಶ 
ಇತ್ಯಾದಿ ಇತ್ಯಾದಿ

ನ್ಯಾಯವಾಗಿ ಚರ್ಚೆಯಾಗಬೇಕಿದ್ದ ವಿಶಯಗಳು.
೧. ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರ ಉದ್ಯೋಗ
೨. ಬೆಂಗಳೂರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಆಗುತ್ತಿರುವ ಎಗ್ಗಿಲ್ಲದ ವಲಸೆ
೩. ಕಾವೇರಿ ಮತ್ತು ಮಹದಾಯಿ
೪. ಹಿಂದೀ ಹೇರಿಕೆಯಿಂದಾಗಿ ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರು ಹೇಗೆ ತಮ್ಮತನವನ್ನು ಕಳೆದುಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ 
೫. ನೀಟ್ ಪರೀಕ್ಷಾ ಪದ್ದತಿಯಿಂದ ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರಿಗೆ ಆಗುತ್ತಿರುವ ಅನ್ಯಾಯಗಳು
ಇತ್ಯಾದಿ..

ಇದೇ ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರಿಗೂ ತಮಿಳರಿಗೂ ಇರುವ ವ್ಯತ್ಯಾಸ...

ತಮಿಳರನ್ನು ಏಕೆ ಪ್ರಪಂಚದ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಜನರೂ ಗೌರವಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ, ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರು ತಮ್ಮ ನೆಲದಲ್ಲೇ ಏಕೆ ಪರಕೀಯರಾಗಿದ್ದಾರೆ ಎನ್ನುವುದು ಇದೇ ಕಾರಣಕ್ಕೆ. 

"ಯಾರದೋ ತಲೆನೋವಿಗೆ ಮುಲಾಮು ಹಚ್ಚಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವ" ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರಿಗೆ ಈ ಸಂದೇಶ ತಲುಪಿಸೋಣ....
ಎಚ್ಚೆತ್ತುಕೊಳ್ಳಿ ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರೇ...

07/12/17, 9:46 AM - Vishak: A sexy Irish blonde at a Casino, seemed a little intoxicated😇
 She bet 20,000 Euro on a single roll of dice.

She said - "I hope you don't mind, but I feel luckier when I'm nude".

With that she removed her clothes, rolled the dice and yelled - "come on baby, Mama needs new clothes!"

As the dice came to a stop, she jumped and yelled - "yes yes, I won.....I won...."

She hugged each dealer and picked up her winnings and clothes and left.

The dealers gazed at each other, dumbfounded. Finally one of them asked - "What number was rolled on the dice?"

The other - "I don't know, I thought you were watching."

Moral of the story:

- not all drunks are drunk
- not all blondes are dumb
- but all Men are Men😂😂😂😂😂

08/12/17, 1:38 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: America
08/12/17, 1:39 PM - Anni jss: The other party if it's in power won't co-operate with the party in power in the centre
08/12/17, 1:39 PM - Vishak: Thing is the opposition is not doing job properly
08/12/17, 1:39 PM - Anni jss: Like BJP at centre and congi here
08/12/17, 1:39 PM - Vishak: Otherwise it is critical to have opposition in democracy
08/12/17, 1:40 PM - Vishak: Imagine if Congress was ruling
08/12/17, 1:40 PM - Vishak: Then would u say the same
08/12/17, 1:40 PM - Anni jss: State govt won't give due credit to centre govt and vice versa
08/12/17, 1:40 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Same man, if congress wins the entire India should come under that, and if BJP wins again same

08/12/17, 1:42 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I agree
08/12/17, 1:42 PM - Anni jss: In Tamil nadu whichever govt is there, they support centre govt and take all benefits
08/12/17, 1:42 PM - Vishak: I know what's happening now is opposition is causing more of disruption than any meaningful intervention
08/12/17, 1:42 PM - Vishak: But it is meant for voice from all sides
08/12/17, 1:42 PM - Anni jss: Starting from Kaveri issue, coal, power, nuclear power plant, industries, railways etc
08/12/17, 1:43 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I still remember when this 26/11 happened. Central government ordered domestic military camps in TN and AP and Kerala but not in KAR, because central was Cong and State was BJP
08/12/17, 1:43 PM - Anni jss: If power is with one party, opposition will work more meaningfully
08/12/17, 1:43 PM - Anni jss: Correct
08/12/17, 1:43 PM - Vishak: No man that powerful party might miss use it too
08/12/17, 1:44 PM - Anni jss: Airports if u see, Karnataka has only one major.. sports development, Bangalore is the only one to host a intl cricket match.. where as others have 2-3 intl stadiums
08/12/17, 1:44 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Even the mandate has to happen for entire nation at once, like US. Then you will have opinion

08/12/17, 1:47 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Same people should not stand for election, new candidates has to come, they can set 10 years max per person and they shouldn't compete again
08/12/17, 1:47 PM - Anni jss: So what? Since more ppl, more ppl want power.. that's why all these central, state, district, Zilla, civic body elections
08/12/17, 1:47 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: This is correct
08/12/17, 1:48 PM - Vishak: It won't work
08/12/17, 1:48 PM - Vishak: It's not europe

10/12/17, 10:25 PM - Vishak: Men's Pearls of Wisdom😍

🌾1. When I was born, I was given a choice - A big dick or a good memory. I don't remember, what I chose.

🌾2. Your birth certificate is an apology letter from the condom factory.

🌾3. A wife is a sex object. Every time you ask for sex, she objects.

🌾4. Impotence: Nature's way of saying 'No hard feelings...'

🌾5. There are only two four letter words that are offensive to men - 'don't' and 'stop', unless they are used together.

🌾6. Panties: Not the best thing on earth, but next to the best thing on earth.

🌾7. There are three stages of sex in a man's life: Tri Weekly, Try Weekly, and Try Weakly.

🌾8. Virginity can be cured.

🌾9. Virginity is not dignity, its lack of opportunity.

🌾10. Having sex is like playing bridge. If you don't have a good partner, you'd better have a good hand.

🌾11. I tried phone sex once, but the holes in the dialer were too small.

🌾12. Marriage is the only war where you get to sleep with the enemy.

🌾13. Q: What's an Australian kiss?
      A: The same thing as a French kiss, only down under.

🌾14. A couple just married were happy with the whole thing. He was happy with the Hole and she was happy with the Thing......

🌾15. Q: What are the three biggest tragedies in a mans life?
     A: Life sucks, job sucks, and the wife doesn't

🌾16. Q: Why do men find it difficult to make eye contact?
     A: Breasts don't have eyes.

🌾17. Despite the old saying, ' Don 't take your troubles to bed', many men still sleep with their wives!!

🌾18. Breasts are proof that men can focus on 2 things at a time

Send to the men with a good sense of humour ...

14/12/17, 11:07 PM - Vishak: The Government is proposing a Bill by which if the bank is having financial difficulties then they can ask depositors to take a hit.

The Finance Ministry have got a Bill approved by the Cabinet called 
"The Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, 2017" and this has now been referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee before getting it passed in the Parliament.

This Bill introduces the provision for a “bail-in”, whose purpose is to provide capital to absorb the losses of a bank and ensure its survival. Here, survival does not mean safety of depositors’ money, but restoration of capital of the bank. 
The bail-in empowers the bank to cancel a liability owed by the bank or change the form of an existing liability to another security.

*In simple words, it means that your savings account balance of Rs.15 lacs, can be reduced to Rs.1 lac, which is mandatory by law.*
 OR they can convert your savings account balance of Rs.15 lacs to a Fixed Deposit, repayable after 5 years, giving you of 5% annual interest. 

And you can do nothing about it. 
View this link, to know more. http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/banking-on-legislation/article20005363.ece

To recover the money from the defaulters, there is no attempt so far by the Reserve Bank of India to blacklist these entities from getting further loans or prevent their managements from retaining a majority equity stake, as penalty for the huge haircuts (writing off loans) being taken by banks.

*In a nut-shell they are now trying to shift the responsibility of rescuing the "sinking banks" from the Govt. to the Suppliers & Depositors of the Bank.* 
Trust in Banking Industry would be decimated. People would gradually close all their bank accounts and keep their cash under the bed. 

Share this extensively thru' every social media. This bill should not be allowed to become an act.

16/12/17, 1:34 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Annual  apology

 Over the past few months I have forwarded some inappropriate pictures and jokes to friends who I thought shared the same sense of humor.. 

Unfortunately this wasn't the case and I seem to have upset quite a few people who have accused me of being sexist and shallow..  

If you were one of these people, please accept my sincerest apologies. 

Looking to 2018 onward, I will only post or send e-mail with a cultural or educational content such as old monuments, nature and other interesting topics.  

Below is a picture of the Pont Neuf Bridge in Paris .  It is the oldest bridge in Paris and took 26 years to build.   It was completed in 1604..

21/12/17, 1:11 PM - hrushikesh ms: A True Incident
In the yr 1979, near the Trivandrum sea shore an Elderly Gentleman was reading the Bhagavad Gita. That time, a young Talented Atheist guy came & sat besides that Gentleman.
The young guy Taunted the Gentleman by saying that in the age of science, people are so foolish that they read old fashioned books like the Gita.

He further said that, had you devoted this same time to science, then by now the country would have scaled great heights.

The Gentleman asked the young man for his introduction to which the youth replied that he was a science graduate from Kolkata who had come to make his career in Bhabha Atomic Research Center.

The youth further told the Gentleman go devote his attention to scientific research as by reading the Bhagavad Gita, he wouldn't be able to achieve anything.
The Gentleman smiled & got up to leave. As soon as he got up, his four security guards surrounded him & his driver brought his red beacon fitted official car. Seeing all this the youth panicked & asked the Gentleman, who are U.
The Gentleman replied that his name is Vikram Sarabhai, the Chairman of the same organization, where the youth had come to make his career.
At that point of time, there were 13 research organizations in the name of Vikram Sarabhai, along with which he was also the Chairman of Commitee for Atomic Planning, having being appointed to the same by the PM Indira Gandhi.
Now, it was the turn of the youth to be ashamed & he fell down on Sarabhai's feet, crying profusely. It was then that Sarabhai said a very Wonderful thing.

He said, "*Behind every creation, there's always the Creator. So, it doesn't matter, whether it is the time of the Mahabharat or Today's India. Never Forget God !!!
Today's Atheist people, by invoking the name of science, may dance as much as they want but history is witness that Science has been created by God believing Theists only.
*God is Eternal Truth. God's speech (Bhagavad Gita) is true; it cannot be Falsified at all. Just by worshipping it, troubles will surely get resolved.*

He replied, it's Petrol. 

When I asked why don't you try Kerosene?  His reply was, the engine will be spoiled. 

I again asked him, do you drink alcohol?? 

He quietly said 'yes'.

When I questioned, won't it spoil your engine??? 

He humbly replied, it's only occasionally... 

My question is, can we pour kerosene occasionally in our bike for a change??? 

No - we cannot. 

We give more value to our Rs 60000 bike but not for our life. 

Our life is more valuable and more Important.

23/12/17, 10:06 PM - Vishak: Talk politics ter
23/12/17, 10:07 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I am not imposing violence panda, see the thing is we should love and respect both religion but here in India from last few years as I observed they are giving importance to only Christian and Muslim festivals and they have disregarded all the Hindu festivals, the best and the recent example is Hanuman Jayanti
23/12/17, 10:07 PM - Vishak: Simply talking shit all time
23/12/17, 10:07 PM - Vishak: Wat happened in Hanuman jayanti ?

23/12/17, 10:09 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Hanuman Jayanti they have band the procession and instead of that one they have given permission for some muslim festival I don't know I forgot its name
23/12/17, 10:09 PM - Lola Infosys: They didn't allow posters also. But tippu jayanti was done grandly. See Pratap Simha tweets

23/12/17, 10:12 PM - Vishak: Any time by minorities
23/12/17, 10:12 PM - Vishak: Ter only u find the answer
23/12/17, 10:13 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Saving Hinduism nowadays has become a vital part, because so much of conversion. see I am not dividing between UPA and NDA  but if you observe closely whatever the opposition happening for the Hindus and Hindu festival that particular state government is always Congress or communist or leftist party so why I personally support BJP is because hindutva and for you also Panda before loving the world you should love yourself your mother father and your family. because if you can't love and protect your family nobody can and nobody will
23/12/17, 10:14 PM - Vishak: Lo if u see tat take action
23/12/17, 10:14 PM - Vishak: I won't stop
23/12/17, 10:14 PM - Vishak: But don't be in presumption
23/12/17, 10:15 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: And it is still presumption even with the data and the daily things which are happening around us
23/12/17, 10:15 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: 🤣🤣

23/12/17, 10:21 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: When people opposing digital India how can we get a copy of the implementation or The Exodus whatever the thing happening in Kashmir without being there
23/12/17, 10:22 PM - Theja: Great minds discuss ideas; averageminds discuss events; small minds discuss people
23/12/17, 10:22 PM - Vishak: Thing is I can't change u but my only advice is everyone has the right to have opinion but don't impose on all, secondly act on facts and third is wat is the point talking so extensively when u never going to take part in solving any of those
23/12/17, 10:25 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: See the thing is that even I can change you but if somebody is trying to burn my home I cannot tie my hands and surrender I will fight. it's just that I don't have power right now and as I read some great man told pen is mightier than sword, if you can't express you cannot do also, every action starts with awareness and discussion this is what I am doing here.
23/12/17, 10:26 PM - Vishak: Ok peace out😁

I have arranged a small party on my  terrace on 31 st dec with arrangements of some refreshing drinks like Black Label , Chivas, Macallan Single Malt and beers followed by delicious dinner. 



I suggest you all to arrange the same on your terrace to avoid the traffic and enjoy the 31 with your own better half.


Regards ....

28/12/17, 1:58 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: "Shaata" is an offensive word. It's actual meaning is pubic hair, which makes it unfit to use in a public place. NOT FOR US!! 😎😎 the number of ways and situations in which we use this word is amazing. And funny. 😋 here are some. 

Swear - lo shaata! 

Greeting - Yeno shaatve..

Sarcasm - Hu haudu shaata.

Surprise - yen guru Shaata idu!!

Comparison - Neen nan mundhe shaatanu illa..

Challenge - yen Shaata kithkothiya naanoo nodthini!!

Degrading - magne yellardru hogi Shaata thari.

Disappointment - iden Shaata guru iduu..

Denial - Shaata nu illa.

Insult - Neen nan Shaatad samaana. 

don't care - ayyo nan shaatakkenu. 
 
Ignorance - nangen gottu shaata?

And the most important one: 
Order - SHAATA THERI!!!! 😂😂

Shaata thariyakke kalsilla idanna... yella share madrappa. 😜😜

Time flies
Dreams are still up in the skies..

From appreciation to promotion
Got memorable things in professional life
From friendship to love n care
Got lovely feelings in personal life..

I saw in her eyes
What she couldn't explain in words..
I felt in my heart
What people cannot express in art..

I lost my whole
When i saw her with stole..
I lost my track
When i saw her in black..

I loved her style
When she had a smile..
I felt my life was a fail
When she was pale..

My life was full
When she smiled mouthful..
My life was null
When she was dull..

There were days
My eyes were full of tears..
There were days
My heart was happiest in years..

From goa to America
Saw numerous places around world..
From food to drinks
Tried everything but always needed curd..

There ain't no regrets
For all my deeds..
There isn't an end
For all my needs..

Life is good
With mixture of bitter n butter..
Things could have been better
If the bitter turned sweeter..

Bye bye
2017
Hi Hi
2018

Time flies
Dreams are still up in the skies..
When going gets tough
Tough gets going..

03/01/18, 4:40 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Sydney blew up 8,000 kg of fireworks last night. Dubai scored a Guinness World Record by launching 479,651 firework shells in 6 minutes. And these are just 2 places of 2 cities out of 4,416 other cities that celebrated new year's eve. Not a single celebrity cringed. No one cried. Nobody's dog had a problem. Instead there were selfies, smiles and joy all around. And the best part is that with such a gigantic production, the whole world must be totally oxygenated today. Feels so awesome, no? New Year's Eve is a mysterious night for every scientist & chemical engineer. 

Because this is the only time in the year when firecrackers emit oxygen. That's why despite all the fireworks throughout the world, no environmentalist has a problem, because it emits only oxygen today, while on other days, and especially on festivals like Deepavali, it emits carbon dioxide & all kinds of toxins. 

This is something which has puzzled scientists worldwide & has still remained a mystery.
03/01/18, 4:40 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: ಓದಲು ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿದೆ...

ವಯಸ್ಸು 20 ಇರುವಾಗ "ಸ್ವದೇಶ" ಮತ್ತು "ವಿದೇಶ " ಎರಡೂ ಒಂದೇ. (ನೀವು ಎಲ್ಲಿದ್ದರೂ ಪರವಾಗಿಲ್ಲ. ಅಲ್ಲಿಗೆ ಹೊಂದಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವಿರಿ)

ವಯಸ್ಸು 30 ಆದಾಗ " ರಾತ್ರಿ" ಮತ್ತು "ಹಗಲು " ಎರಡೂ ಒಂದೇ ( ಕೆಲವು ದಿನ ನಿದ್ದೆ ಇಲ್ಲ ದಿದ್ದರೂ ಏನೂ ತೊಂದರೆ ಆಗಲ್ಲ)

ವಯಸ್ಸು 40 ಆದಾಗ " ಅತಿ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಓದಿದವರು" ಮತ್ತು "ಕಡಿಮೆ ಓದಿದವರು " ಒಂದೇ ( ಕಡಿಮೆ ಓದಿದವರೂ ಕೆಲವೊಮ್ಮೆ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಸಂಪಾದಿ ಸುತ್ತಾರೆ)

ವಯಸ್ಸು 50 ಆದಾಗ 
ಸೌಂದರ್ಯ ಮತ್ತು ಕುರೂಪ ಒಂದೇ (ನೀವು ಎಷ್ಟೇ ಸುಂದರವಾಗಿದ್ದರೂ ಚರ್ಮ ನೆರಿಗೆ ಬೀಳುವುದು, ಅಲ್ಲಲ್ಲಿ ಕಪ್ಪಾಗುವುದು ಮುಚ್ಚಿಡಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ)

ವಯಸ್ಸು 60 ಆದಾಗ ಎತ್ತರದ ಸ್ಥಾನ, ಕೆಳಗಿನ ಸ್ಥಾನ ಒಂದೇ (ನಿವೃತ್ತಿ ಗೊಂಡ ಮೇಲೆ ಪೇದೆ ಆಗಿದ್ದವನೂ ಮೇನೇಜರ್ ಗೆ ಹಿಂದಿನ ಗೌರವ ಕೊಡಲಾರ)

ವಯಸ್ಸು 70 ಆದಾಗ "ದೊಡ್ಡ ಮನೆ " ಮತ್ತು "ಸಣ್ಣ ಮನೆ " ಒಂದೇ... (ಸಂದು ನೋವು, ಚಲಿಸಲು ಕಷ್ಟ, ಇದ್ದವರಿಗೆ ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ಜಾಗ ಕೂರಲು ಸಿಕ್ಕರೆ ಸಾಕು)

ವಯಸ್ಸು 80 ಆದಾಗ "ಹಣ ಇರುವುದು "   ಹಣ ಇಲ್ಲದಿರುವುದು ಒಂದೇ (ನಿಮಗೆ ಹಣ ಖರ್ಚು  ಮಾಡಬೇಕೆನ್ನಿಸಿದರೂ ಎಲ್ಲಿ ಖರ್ಚು ಮಾಡಬೇಕೆಂದು ತಿಳಿಯುವುದಿಲ್ಲ)

ವಯಸ್ಸು 90 ಆದಾಗ " ನಿದ್ದೆ ಮಾಡೋದು ಹಾಗೂ " ಎಚ್ಚರದಿಂದಿರುವುದು " ಎರಡೂ ಒಂದೇ (ಎದ್ದ ಮೇಲೆ ಏನು ಮಾಡಬೇಕೆಂದು ಗೊತ್ತಿರುವುದಿಲ್ಲ)

ಜೀವನವನ್ನು ಹಗುರವಾಗಿ ತೆಗೊಳ್ಳಿ'... ಅಲ್ಲಿ ಭೇದಿಸಬೇಕಾದ 
ರಹಸ್ಯಗಳು ಇಲ್ಲ...

ದೀರ್ಘಾವದಿಯ ಜೀವನ ನೋಡಿದರೆ ನಾವೆಲ್ಲಾ ಒಂದೇ '
ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಒತ್ತಡ / ಆತಂಕ ಗಳನ್ನು ಮರೆತು ಜೀವನವನ್ನು ಆನಂದಿಸಿರಿ.

05/01/18, 1:59 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: A young sexy  woman passing by a pet shop saw a board -  "Monkey who does great sex".
She went in, bought that monkey & walked away with the Instruction Manual.
The Manual said "Give a good bath to the monkey, then you take a bath. Make him sit on the bed and you lie down without wearing anything. Leave the rest to the monkey. Repeat all steps for repeat performance".
Accordingly, the woman gave the monkey a bath, bathed herself and slept on the bed naked. Monkey did nothing.
Disappointed, she again gave him a bath, had bath and lied down naked on the bed.
Again, the monkey did nothing.
She referred the Manual to check for forward path. It said : In case of no activity, call the shop owner for support.
She called the owner & he arrived in 10 minutes.
He asked the woman to lie down. He then looked at the monkey and shouted...
"This is the last time I'm teaching you..!"

05/01/18, 5:09 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Famed actor Arnold Schwarzenegger posted a photo of him sleeping on the street under his famous bronze statue, and sadly wrote "how times have changed". The reason he wrote the phrase was not only because he was old, but because when he was governor of California he inaugurated a hotel with his statue. Hotel staff told Arnold, "at any moment you can come and have a room reserved for you." when Arnold stepped down as governor and went to the hotel, the administration refused to give him a room arguing that he should pay for it, since they were in great demand.
He brought a sleeping bag and stood underneath the statue and explained what he wanted to convey: "When I was in an important position, they always complimented me, and when I lost this position, they forgot about me and did not keep their promise. Do not trust your position or the amount of money you have, nor your power, nor your intelligence, it will not last. "

Trying to teach everyone that when you're "Important" in the people's eyes , everyone is your "Friend" But once you don't benefit their interests , you won't matter.

"Nothing lasts forever."

05/01/18, 6:55 PM - Lola Infosys: During a company's annual family trip to a crocodile farm in Thailand... the eccentric Boss dared any of his employees to jump into the crocodiles infested pond... and swim to the shore.

Anyone who survived the swim will be rewarded with 5 million... but if killed by the crocs...2 million will be given to the next of kin.

For a long period of time no one dared take up the challenge... then suddenly a man jumped in...and swam frantically for his life towards shore pursued by the crocs...and luckily he made it unscathed.

When he managed to recover his breath... the man, who became instant millionaire, shouted asking who pushed him into the pond..... it was his wife who did it.!!!

And from that day...that was how the phrase... "Behind every successful man...there's a woman"...came about !!!😜🤣

09/01/18, 5:45 PM - Vishak: To remove that government must make survey and see whther the particular community is ecomoically backward or not
09/01/18, 5:46 PM - Vishak: Also I feel most of the poor people belong to low caste only
09/01/18, 5:46 PM - Theja: Lol
09/01/18, 5:46 PM - Vishak: I don't think people who clean and all will be upper caste

09/01/18, 5:57 PM - Anni jss: Indian Railways one of biggest employers in the world has reservation..
09/01/18, 5:58 PM - Anni jss: State govt, central govt, govt schools, colleges, bescom, bbmp, police, govt hospitals... Inna esht beku guru
09/01/18, 5:59 PM - Anni jss: Corporate employees is very very minimal in india
09/01/18, 5:59 PM - Vishak: Actually ter is something called informal sector
09/01/18, 5:59 PM - Vishak: It contributes to 94% job in india
09/01/18, 6:00 PM - Anni jss: Take into consideration authority, police, court, offices in every state and city and see how many are govt jobs
09/01/18, 6:00 PM - Vishak: It can considered semi private only

09/01/18, 6:03 PM - Vishak: But I tell in a senario where u have to choose among 2 who will u favor will come into picture
09/01/18, 6:04 PM - Vishak: So if a community of ppl don't like the other community there is a change the backward community will remain backward only
09/01/18, 6:05 PM - Vishak: But not to say in 70 years actually the improvement which was expected backward community is very less percentage so in someway u can say the reservation system is flawed
09/01/18, 6:14 PM - Anni jss: Reservation system was not flawed.. ambedkar did it with a clear intention.. but people and politicians miss utilizing
09/01/18, 6:26 PM - Theja: Even after 600 years we have casteism,
So until we have it we will have caste based reservation.

The benefits are really hype . Railways 5k kind sweeper tc who cares
09/01/18, 6:30 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Actually cast system boomed only after the British invasion, Earlier there are many exemples of intercaste marriages
09/01/18, 6:31 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: One British officer segregated the Indians according the size of their nose.
09/01/18, 6:32 PM - Anni jss: That's why, those sweepers should also focus on studying from the beginning and not think, anyways we are minorities, we will get a job for sure.. why to study
09/01/18, 6:32 PM - Vishak: Correct ani
09/01/18, 6:32 PM - Anni jss: That's what siddu's govt is doing..
09/01/18, 6:33 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: All siddu did was sleep and dividing Lingayat community
09/01/18, 6:33 PM - Vishak: Ya dabba😆
09/01/18, 6:33 PM - Anni jss: Give rice for 1 rupee per kg for poor, lunch for 10 rupees etc.. they will become more lazy cos they are getting food cheaply
09/01/18, 6:33 PM - Nikil Play: That's good thing
09/01/18, 6:33 PM - Anni jss: That's why they call 'doles are a bane for economy'
09/01/18, 6:33 PM - Nikil Play: So Hindu will be Hindu only
09/01/18, 6:34 PM - Vishak: But thing is lingyat community was formed to fight casteism
09/01/18, 6:34 PM - Nikil Play: He won't get converted to Another religion
09/01/18, 6:34 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Like Amma of TN, giving basic necessity and cheating major issues
09/01/18, 6:34 PM - Vishak: It doesn't follow Vedic structure
09/01/18, 6:35 PM - Nikil Play: *ppl
09/01/18, 6:35 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lo it follows, basavanna fought to teach vedas for all,

09/01/18, 6:35 PM - Vishak: Lo Vedic structure is different
09/01/18, 6:35 PM - Vishak: It means division based on work
09/01/18, 6:36 PM - Vishak: At tat time
09/01/18, 6:36 PM - Anni jss: Lingayat community was formed to eliminate the way of performing Pooja and include all castes in one.. between, basavanna was a Brahmin before forming lingayat community
09/01/18, 6:36 PM - Vishak: Ya
09/01/18, 6:36 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Yeddy is lingayat, so those people vote him no matter what, so siddu wanted to break the major community of Karnataka
09/01/18, 6:37 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: The thing all following is not vedic, it killed after the invasion
09/01/18, 6:37 PM - Anni jss: Correct.. Congress already has minority and Muslim votes.. he wanted to get lingayat and veerashaiva votes.  Tried to break it.. but failed
09/01/18, 6:37 PM - Nikil Play: I don't want yeddy as cm

19/01/18, 4:09 PM - Lola Infosys: Mr. Dickson had a habit of asking daft questions to his pupils.
 
One day, he asked his 4th graders if anyone knew how to put 2 holes into 1 hole.
 
Since no one was able to answer the question, he told the kids to go home and ask their fathers.
 
Kids came back the next day. No one knew the answer.
 
"Look," said Mr. Dickson, quite enjoying himself while holding his index finger against his thumb, forming a little 'zero'. "This is one hole, my nose has 2 holes, and I can put my hand over my nose and make my nose holes appear inside this other hole."
 
"Ahh, right" said the children.
 
The next day, Little Johnny stood up and said, "Mr. Dickson, my daddy wants to know if you know how to put 7 holes in one hole."
 
"Hmmmm," Mr. Dickson said, "How do you put 7 holes in one? Well, I'll be darned. I don't know how to do that. Um, did your father tell you how to?"
 
"Yes," said Little Johnny, "He asked me to tell you, 'Take a flute and shove it up your ass!'"

```Hello!  Is this Gordon's Pizza?

No sir, it's Google's Pizza.

Did I dial the wrong number?

No sir, Google bought the pizza store.

Oh, alright - then I’d like to place an order please.

Okay sir, do you want the usual?

The usual?  You know what my usual is?

According to the caller ID, the last 15 times you’ve ordered a 12-slice with double-cheese, sausage, and thick crust.

Okay - that’s what I want this time too.

May I suggest that this time you order an 8-slice with ricotta, arugula, and tomato instead?

No, I hate vegetables.

But your cholesterol is not good.

How do you know?

Through the subscribers guide.  We have the results of your blood tests for the last 7 years.

Maybe so, but I don’t want the pizza you suggest – I already take medicine for high cholesterol.

But you haven’t taken the  medicine regularly. 4 months ago you purchased from Drugsale Network a box of only 30 tablets.

I bought more from another drugstore.

It's not showing on your credit card sir.

I paid in cash.

But according to your bank statement you did not withdraw that much cash.

I have another source of cash.

This is not showing on your last tax form, unless you got it from an undeclared income source.

To HELL With Ur Pizza..!!
ENOUGH!!
I'm sick of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. I'm going to an island without internet, where there’s no cellphone line, and no one to spy on me ...

I understand sir, but you’ll need to renew your PASSPORT ... it expired 5 weeks ago.```

30/01/18, 1:04 PM - Vishak: Australia is an expensive country but the civic services are of the best standards.

Once a family from Kanpur, was on holidays in Australia.
Apart from his wife and two children, this man from Kanpur was also accompanied by his old age father.

They were traveling on one of the express ways. 

This Indian Family was in their car and was followed by a Local Aussie Lady, driving at a safe distance.

Suddenly the Aussie Lady saw a head of an old man coming out of the window and vomiting blood.
She took a quick action and informed the 911 for help.

In no time, there appeared an Air Ambulance Helicopter.

The well trained staff quickly shifted that old man on the stretcher. Oxygen supply started. Doctors started examining him. Sometime later, the old man was declared safe and fit to travel again. 
Kudos to Quick Help and Well Done The Aussie Lady.

But these services, our Kanpur Hero had to pay US$ 3500.

With these unplanned heavy financial charges, the Kanpur man was in shock and he blasted on his Old Aged Father : *"Gutkha kha kar khidki ke bahar pichkari maarne ki kya zarurat thi.?"* 
🤣😳😜🤔😲😝😂

31/01/18, 9:09 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: It is not said that you should completely stop eating foods during this day, but one must have light foods that are easy to digest. On this day, your body has a cooling effect, which in turn makes your digestive system slow and produces lesser digestive juices, which is why it is mostly recommended that you shouldn't be eating too many heavy foods
31/01/18, 9:11 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Our body is 70% water. When something as large as the ocean is affected by full moon and new moon- causing high tides and low tides- the body is also affected.
31/01/18, 9:11 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Due to the large amounts of micro-organic death during this celestial phenomenon, cleanliness is given high importance. It is recommended to take a shower before and after the eclipse

31/01/18, 9:15 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I basically believe whenever new moon occurs there will be fluctuations on gravity. Thus in fact affects slightly, which may be positive or negative. And its not give a visible effect.
31/01/18, 9:15 PM - Vishak: Ya
31/01/18, 9:15 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: It's like consuming alcohol, you won't die right away but your die for sure after years

02/02/18, 10:15 AM - Lola Infosys: 1. Standard deductions of 40000 replaces 34200 existing reimbursements. So if you are in 20% tax slab with taxable income 10lac... U get 20% of 5800(40000-34200) i.e., *₹1160* benefit.

2. Edu cess increased from 3 to 4% so if your income is 10lac you are paying 112500 tax. 1% additional tax on this i.e., *₹1125*. 

*So ₹1160-₹1125, salaried class get ₹35 relief!*

Enjoy 😊

2. There will be no GST on Cloths
3.From all defense Purchases, somebody will get 50% Commission
4. Amir Khan and his wife will find India is again safe to live
5. Once again Murderers, Rapists, Corrupt will get in to High Positions
6.Kashmir will become haven for Separatists
7. Pakistan will strengthens its propaganda because Persons of earlier rulers went to beg Pakistan to help remove Modi from Power
8. Then Love-Jihad, Triple talaak, Killing cow will become legal
9. Owaisi Brothers start telling that they can kill all Hindus in 15 Minutes
10. Mamata Banerjee will hand over the state of west Bengal to Bangladeshi Muslims a
11. A Joker & Comedian will become Prime Minister and entertain total world and will be called Village Woman
12. Robert Vadra will buy total Haryana
13. Again Country will flourish with one scam after another like past 70 Years!
14. Awards are once again given back to award waapsee gang and some may even get PADMA Awards too
15. All the new projects will be named after Nehru-Gandhi Parivar
16.News Channels will have better TRP Ratings due to discussions on Scams
17. Modi may become CM of Gujarat since the people there know that he can bring prosperity to their state.
18. Skill India will become SCAM - India
19. During terrorist attack the army have to wait for 5 Days to get nod & Clearance from Government
20. Then Media will be after YOGI the way they were after Modi when he was CM of Gujarat
21.Every year New Projects will be opened on the name of Indira Gandhi & Rajiv Gandhi
22. Centre will never look at North East and no further aid for their Growth
23. Arvind Kejriwal will be declared as Prophet of Clean Politics.
24. Muslims will get back their First right on National resources
25.People will surely realize the blunder committed by them and by then, lot of bad would have occurred
26. Lalu Prasad, Karti Chidambaram, Sasikala, YS.Jagan Mohan Reddy will be declared Honest and rewarded with High Positions.
27. And MODI..
He will lead a life of Solitude and Peace. He tried his level best to work hard for bettering things. But Indians were as usual selfish, spineless, mean people who can sell their Consciousness for few Notes of Currency.

05/02/18, 3:54 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: So all media grinding her for insensitive and irrelevant comment
05/02/18, 3:56 PM - Anni jss: I am not a very big fan of writing serious stuff related to debatable issues like Politics, Religion, Economy etc on Facebook as I believe that it is my personal space meant for sharing a few laughs and life updates with my friends and family. If at all, I ever talk about it, I always crack some joke related to it.

On 1st February 2018, Finance Minister presented the General Budget in the Parliament and I, like any other salaried middle class was glued to the television just to listen to the point of my interest, that is, how much tax relief will be given to me this time. The announcement of tax rebate never came. Like all the salaried middle class, I got very angry and vowed not to vote for this government ever again. Slowly, but surely, my anger subsided and then I decided to look for any valid reason due to which they decided this. I had made up the mind to punish them in next elections if I could find that a grave Injustice had been done to me and hence, I did R&D on my own so that I don’t follow the herd mentality and make an informed choice. Since this information is very important, therefore I am sharing this with all of you here. 

1. My home loan interest rate at the end of 2013 was between 9.5 to 11.25%. It has come down to under 8.5% now. (Keeping SBI as Reference) Even a difference of 2% Rate in a loan of 30 lakhs gives you savings of 45000 Annually, as per SBI Home loan calculator. Is that not for middle class? 

2. Average Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 10.92% in 2013 while it is 2.49% right now. JUST IMAGINE, what would have been the prices of the goods of common usage if such a high CPI rate was still there. 

3. Fiscal Deficit was 4.1% in 2013 while it has been targeted to be 3.3% for 2018 (Through this budget only). If we don’t reign in the fiscal deficit, it will lead to manipulation of capital structures, interest rates, will lead to decrease of net exports and will result in even higher taxes and higher inflation. So, dear friends, the budget is also aimed at keeping the inflation in check (Such are the strange ways of Economics)

4. One thing which I can’t understand is the fuel prices. Petrol Price was INR 78.46 in Mumbai in 2013 while it is now 80.94. Same is the case with Diesel as it was INR 60.8 in 2013 and now it is INR 68.25. 

5. Let us now come to the moot point, that is, the Tax rebate for Salaried middle class. Big decisions like these can never be viewed in Silo. We also need to find out a pattern and if there is any rationale behind it. Most of us were expecting at least a tax slab raise to INR 3 lakh per annum from INR 2.5 Lakh per annum which means a saving of INR 2500 per annum as it in any case fetches a tax of 5% only to the Government or INR 208 per month. Is it such a big amount that our world will turn upside down? Remember, it is just INR 2500 savings for us but for the government, it is an extra spend of INR 2500 x 6.3 Crore = 15750 Crore. Is it a small amount? So, just for the sake of savings of 208 per month, Government would have to bear the brunt of 15750 Crore extra and remember, this would have been further added into fiscal deficit as explained above which in any case would come back to haunt you in the form of higher taxes and inflation. 

6. Now, comes the most important point. Go through it and then decide your voting preference. From 2009 to 2014, the tax rebate ceiling was increased from 1.6 lakhs to 2 lakhs per annum. From 2014 till date, the ceiling has been increased from 2 lakh to 2.5 lakh. For senior citizens, it has been increased to 3 lakh and for very senior citizens, it has been increased to 5 lakh. Home loan deduction limit has been hiked to 2 Lakh. Also, don’t forget that from 2.5 lakh to 5 lakh income, you are now required to pay 5% tax instead of the earlier 10% and also, the standard deduction of INR 40000 has also come into picture now. Stent prices were reduced to 35000 from 1.5 lakhs and knee replacement cost dropped down to 45000 from 1.5 lakhs. Insurance of 2 lakh Rs at Annual Premium of Rs 333 is also given by this Government. Are these not for middle class?  This government is the one which has actually given the most to the salaried middle class and we are planning to remove the same government to bring one which in any case will keep taking taxes from us and will keep filling its pockets instead of using the tax money properly?

So, in a nutshell, this government has already given a lot to middle class honest tax payers like me. I am already saving around 45000 Rs annually with drop in home loan interest rate and still I am unhappy that an annual tax saving of Rs 2500 has not been given to me. Is it justified? Yes, they might be charging more as far as Fuel Prices are concerned but I still know, that all my tax money, whether it is in the form of Direct tax, or Indirect Tax, is not going into the pockets of Corrupt Politicians of the previous regime. Just because I got angry because I was expecting tax Rebate because this was the last full budget of the Government before general elections and hence, I was EXPECTING some doles for me, doesn’t mean that I will again throw my country into the same quagmire of corruption & red tapism that my country has been suffering since 1947. It was the media and our own psyche that built up that expectation and not the government. They never gave any official indications or statements.

If I am able to convince even 1 person with this post of mine, I will assume that the extra pains I took to write such a long write-up has paid off. Forward as received ... but nyc analysis

05/02/18, 4:02 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: And also according to recent survey 73% of wealth is with 1% of citizens in India.
It is not fault of any government, it is a like chosen by the citizen itself. 95% of people wants salaried jobs and only few will start their own company.

No one wants to Rule, all they want is being ruled
05/02/18, 4:05 PM - Anni jss: The only point middle class is making in this budget is, tax exemption was not made up to 3lk and tax slabs were not changed

05/02/18, 5:03 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: A man goes into the hospital for a vasectomy.

Before the procedure, a very attractive nurse comes in and takes his vitals, then tells him to take all of his clothes off.

When he is fully undressed, she instructs him to lie down on the table. He obeys. 

The nurse  then takes all of her clothes off and climbs on top of him and has her way with him.

Upon the completion of the act, he catches his breath and asks what that was all about. 

The nurse informs the patient that studies have shown that before a vasectomy if the man has an ejaculation, he will be more relaxed and that the cord is easier for the surgeon to locate and sever, thereby making the surgery safer, more efficient and quicker.

She then wheels the patient, to the operating room. 

While they are going down the hall, he looks through a window to the right and sees six men in a room masturbating.

Curious, he asks, "What are they doing in there"?

The nurse responds, "They're preparing for vasectomies too, but whereas you have come through Corporate Mediclaim, they have come through the State Government's Suvarna Arogya Bhagya scheme !"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

06/02/18, 9:38 AM - Vishak: Lo ani
06/02/18, 9:38 AM - Anni jss: If everyone who is eligible to pay tax, pays it, then revenue increases by leaps and bounds and I think, all the other taxes come down since govt is getting money from income tax itself
06/02/18, 9:39 AM - Vishak: 60% of wealth is with top 1%

06/02/18, 9:42 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I read somewhere, people like Ambani mittal and all not come under regular tax pay, cause they make income in a different way. Whatever it is in your case exclude 60% and let's count 40 and those also not paying tax.
06/02/18, 9:43 AM - Anni jss: Ambani, Narayan Murthy, mittal they have more perks than income. They do it purposefully to avoid tax.
06/02/18, 9:47 AM - Vishak: My point they are not giving correct money
06/02/18, 9:48 AM - Vishak: Wealth distribution flaw

06/02/18, 9:50 AM - Vishak: Not like they are hiding monwy
06/02/18, 9:51 AM - Vishak: Which ever government who is in power will support the rich only
06/02/18, 9:51 AM - Vishak: For poor they will make shitty schemes and eat some pie of it as well
06/02/18, 9:54 AM - Vishak: The point we are discussing all whatever happens will happen he can manage coz most of us are financial stahle. It just for talk sake we are discussing but I feel for poor/middle class ,they are not educated to full level, don't have courage to fight, busy in their commitments and don't want take risk

06/02/18, 10:01 AM - Lola Infosys: The recent High Court ruling on Gays has created quite a stir in Karnataka and has made the average kannadiga take a re-look at his daily life. 
  
The native Kannadiga family man wakes up in the morning (belaGAY) and discovers that his whole family could be GAY.
 
His father is heard telling his mother : maganGAY, magalGAY, soseGAY. 
 
His wife says appanGAY, ammanGAY, gandanGAY...... and she loves malliGAY.  
 
He gets ready for breakfast........ thindyGAY. here the talk is about nanGay, ninGay . 
 
His favorite home-made sweet dish is holGay. 
 
At work, they talk about : YaarGAY,AvaruGAY, IvaruGAY, hinGAY, hanGAY, elliGAY, alliGAY, bossGAY, secretaryGAY.
 
At his children's school, it is TeachersGAY, StudentsGAY, puneGAY and so on.
 
For entertainment, he goes cinemaGAY
 
The Judiciary and Police are no different. It is JugdeGAY, PoliceGAY, KalruGAY and so on. 
 
Even the non-living things are GAY inclined.. The Kannadiga says busGAY, trainGAY, flightGAY......... 
 
Finally, at the end of the day, he heads back home..........maneGAY.

Kaikeyi was the 3rd wife_ of king dasaratha, he loved her a lot..

Mastani was the 2nd wife_ of Bajirao, he loved her a lot..

Padmavathi was the 2nd wife of Rawal Ratan Singh, his true love and partner

Mumtaz was the 8th wife_ of Shah Jahan, u know he loved her so much that he built Taj Mahal for her...

Jodha was the 3rd wife_ of Akbar, his love for her is still discussed...

History proves that no Husband had ever loved his first wife too much.

Indian - Sir, I might have shared my password with you but I don't think you can still login to my email account. Let's look for the possibilities. My password can be

Or

Onetwothreefourfivesixseveneight

Or

1twothreefourfivesixseveneight

1twothreefourfivesixseven8….. so on

Or

15/02/18, 10:50 PM - Anni jss: This is what PM Modi spoke in his Lok Sabha speech today. He for the first time disclosed that the total amount of NPA in the banks and said they were not 36% as claimed by the Congress but a whopping 82% of bank loans were NPA, which means that 52 lakh crores bank money was given to industrialists by the Congress government without guarantee.

PM Modi said the economy was in a disaster when he took over and if he had disclosed the real state of Banks and economy, every investor in India would have left the country which would have caused a catastrophic effect on the country.

PM Modi said…“Earlier calls used to be made for facilitating loans to their people (close to those in power). Crores of money was given (through loans)…. Had I kept the facts before the nation earlier, it would have hurt the economy.” “ I have remained silent for the sake of Nation, despite knowing what Congress has done, but time has come to reveal truth as banks were getting back into good health and people should know what Congress did in 10 years.”

After the NDA took over, not a single loan was passed which could turn into an NPA, added Modi.

So, one may now realise what is the extent of damage Congress did to our country and economy. This just one scandal lead to a loss of Rs 52 lakh Crore to the Nation.

Yes….520,00,00,00,00,000 crore was the total amount given to these industrialists, now compare this with 2G, CWG Coal and NH scams!

To all Non Bhakts. After hearing the PM speech in parliament today, I hope all must have realized why the Angry Middle Class has been left without any *benefits*. 82% NPA's are the legacy of the *Congress* due to which the present government is *still* struggling to get the economy on track. I hope you realize that the present government is not penalizing you _(by not giving more freebies and tax exemptions)_ but is forced due to the various economic blunders, nepotism and corruption of the *Congress* whom you all are suddenly considering to be your *savior* from the *honest BJP government*. If today, you still believe that the BJP government does not deserve a 2nd term, then *you* are really not deserving of an honest government and country. If you still believe that you need to vote out the BJP then God bless you all because then *even God cannot save this country*.

20/02/18, 11:48 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Indians have to take another birth to understand what is Indian National Congress. 

This is the Power this Party had. Think for a while.

Loan taken by Nirav Modi - 2008.

Scam Happened in 2011.

Audit Of Banks happen each year.

PNB Oldest And Largest Bank after SBI.

RBI under Raghuram Rajan, 
PM - Manmohan Singh , 
FM - Chidambaram and Pranav Mukherjee. 

2008 - No Issue.
2009 - Still No Issue.
2010 - No NPA Red Alert.
2011 - Scam No Red Alert.
2012 - No News.
2013 - No News.
2014 - No News.

RBI Governor changed.
2016 - Demonetization
2017 - RBI compelled and Banks compelled to give clear picture.

ALL OF THIS IS NOW OUT..........Who is the Culprit ? 

You decide...Same Day after Scam Broke Out ED raided and siezed Rs.5100 crore jewels and Assets.

This is how Legalised loot happens which exposed post Demonetisation auditing.

So according to Rahul Gandhi, Nirav Modi met Modi in Davos in 2018 to loot 12000 cr from PNB in 2011..

Sounds familiar like "This morning I wake up at night".. 😂😂😂

21/02/18, 7:12 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: ಪ್ರಧಾನಿ ಮೋದಿಯಿಂದ ಮತ್ತೊಂದು ಮಾಸ್ಟರಸ್ಟ್ರೋಕ್!! ಅಬುಧಾಬಿಯ ಜೊತೆಗಿನ ಈ ಒಪ್ಪಂದ ಜಗತ್ತನ್ನೇ ತಲ್ಲಣಗೊಳಿಸಿದೆ!! ಏನದು ಗೊತ್ತಾ?
ಪ್ರಧಾನ ಮಂತ್ರಿ ನರೇಂದ್ರ ಮೋದಿಜೀ ಇತ್ತೀಚೆಗಷ್ಟೇ ಅಬುಧಾಬಿ ಪ್ರವಾಸ ಮುಗಿಸಿ ಬಂದದ್ದು ತಮಗೆಲ್ಲಾ ಗೊತ್ತೇ ಇದೆ.
ಇಲ್ಲಿದೆ ಅದರ ಕಂಪ್ಲೀಟ್ ಡಿಟೈಲ್ಸ್!!
ನರೇಂದ್ರ ಮೋದಿಜೀ ಅಬುಧಾಬಿ ಪ್ರವಾಸದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ದೊಡ್ಡ ಸುದ್ದಿ ಕೇಳಿಬರುತ್ತಿದೆ. ಮೊದಮೊದಲು ಮೋದಿಜೀ ಅಬುಧಾಬಿಗೆ ತೆರಳಿದ್ದು ಅಲ್ಲಿನ ಮೊದಲ ಹಿಂದೂ ಮಂದಿರದ ಶಿಲಾನ್ಯಾಸಕ್ಕೆ ಅಷ್ಟೇ ಅಂತಲೇ ಭಾವಿಸಲಾಗಿತ್ತು.
ಆದರೆ ಅದಷ್ಟೇ ಅಲ್ಲ ಮೋದಿಜೀ ಅಲ್ಲಿಗೆ ಮತ್ತೊಂದು ಮಹತ್ವದ ಒಪ್ಪಂದ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡು ದೇಶದ ಬಹುದೊಡ್ಡ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಯೊಂದನ್ನ ಬಗೆಹರಿಸಲು ಹೋಗಿದ್ದರು‌ ಅನ್ನೋದು ಸದ್ಯ ಪ್ರಾಪ್ತವಾಗುತ್ತಿರುವ ಮಾಹಿತಿ.
ಪ್ರಧಾನಿ ಮೋದಿಯವರ ಆ ಮಹತ್ವದ ಒಪ್ಪಂದದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ನಿಮಗೆ ತಿಳಿದರೆ ನೀವು ಖಂಡಿತ ಶಾಕ್ ಆಗ್ತೀರ, ಅಷ್ಟಕ್ಕೂ ಮೋದಿಜೀ‌ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡು ಬಂದ ಆ ಒಪ್ಪಂದವಾದರೂ ಏನು ಗೊತ್ತಾ? ಭಾರತದಲ್ಲಿನ ಪೆಟ್ರೋಲ್ ಡೀಸೆಲ್ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಯನ್ನ ನೀಗಿಸಲು ಪ್ರಧಾನಿ ಮೋದಿ ಅಬುಧಾಬಿಗೆ ತೆರಳಿದ್ದರು.
ಅಬುಧಾಬಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಉತ್ಪಾದನೆಯಾಗುವ 10% ಕಚ್ಚಾ ತೈಲ ಭಾರತದ ಪಾಲಾಗಲಿದೆ…
ಭಾರತದ ಓ.ಎನ್.ಜಿ.ಸಿ(Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd) ಅಬುಧಾಬಿಯಲ್ಲಿನ ಆಯಿಲ್ ಫೀಲ್ಡ್ ನಲ್ಲಿ ಬರೋಬ್ಬರಿ 10% ಪಾಲನ್ನ ಖರೀದಿಸಿದೆ. ಇದರ ಸಲುವಾಗಿ ಬರೋಬ್ಬರಿ 60 ಸಾವಿರ ಕೋಟಿಯಷ್ಟು ಹಣವನ್ನ ಅಬುಧಾಬಿಗೆ ನೀಡಲಾಗಿದೆ.
ನಿಮಗೆ ಗೊತ್ತಿರಲಿ, ಈ ರೀತಿಯ ಒಪ್ಪಂದ ಹೆಂದೆಂದೂ ಭಾರತ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ,‌ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ ಅನ್ನುವುದಕ್ಕಿಂತ ಭಾರತವನ್ನ ಹಿಂದೆ ಆಳಿದ್ದ ಲೂಟಿಕೋರರ ಮುಖ ನೋಡಿ ಅರಬ್ ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರಗಳು ಇಂತಹ ಐತಿಹಾಸಿಕ ಒಪ್ಪಂದ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳಲು ಭಾರತಕ್ಕೆ ಅವಕಾಶವೇ ನೀಡಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ
ಆದರೆ ಈಗ ಬಲಿಷ್ಟ ಪ್ರಧಾನಿ ಮೋದಿಯೆಂದರೇ ಇಡೀ ಜಗತ್ತೇ ತಲೆ ಬಾಗಿರೋದನ್ನ ಮನಗಂಡ ಅಬುಧಾಬಿ ಇದೀಗ ಇಂತಹ ಮಹತ್ವದ ಒಪ್ಪಂದವನ್ನ ಭಾರತದ ಜೊತೆ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡಿದೆ. ಈ ಒಪ್ಪಂದದ ಪ್ರಕಾರ ಅಬುಧಾಬಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಉತ್ಪಾದನೆಯಾಗುವ 10% ಕಚ್ಚಾ ತೈಲ ಭಾರತದ ಪಾಲಾಗಲಿದೆ.
ಮೋದಿಜೀ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡಿರುವ ಈ ಮಹತ್ವದ ಒಪ್ಪಂದದ ಪ್ರಕಾರ ಅಬುಧಾಬಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹೊರತೆಗೆಯುವ ಒಟ್ಟು ಕಚ್ಚಾ ತೈಲದ 10% ಭೂಮಿಯನ್ನ ಭಾರತದ ONGC Ltd ಖರೀದಿಸಿದೆ. ಈ ಒಪ್ಪಂದ ಮಾರ್ಚ್ 9, 2018 ರಿಂದ ಜಾರಿಗೆ ಬರಲಿದೆ.
ಭಾರತದಲ್ಲಿನ ಪೆಟ್ರೋಲ್-ಡೀಸೆಲ್ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಗೆ ಸಿಗಲಿದೆ ಮುಕ್ತಿ:
ಪ್ರತಿದಿನ ಸರಿಸುಮಾರು 4 ಲಕ್ಷ ಬ್ಯಾರೆಲ್ ಅಂದರೆ ಒಂದು ವರ್ಷಕ್ಕೆ ಬರೋಬ್ಬರಿ‌ 2 ಕೋಟಿ ಟನ್ ಕಚ್ಚಾ ತೈಲ ಆಯಿಲ್ ಫೀಲ್ಡ್ ನಿಂದ ತೆಗೆಯಲಾಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದು ಇದರ ಶೇ.10 ಅಂದರೆ 20 ಲಕ್ಷ ಟನ್ ಕಚ್ಚಾ ತೈಲ ಪ್ರತಿವರ್ಷ ಭಾರತ ಖರೀದಿಸಿರುವ ಆಯಿಲ್ ಫೀಲ್ಡ್ ನಿಂದ ಭಾರತಕ್ಕೆ ಸಿಗಲಿದೆ. ಆಯಿಲ್ ಫೀಲ್ಡ್ ನಲ್ಲಿ ದಿನ ಕಳೆದಂತೆ ತೈಲ ಉತ್ಪಾದನೆ ಹೆಚ್ಚಾಗುವುದಂತೂ ಖಚಿತ, ಹೇಗೆ ಅಬುಧಾಬಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕಚ್ಚಾ ತೈಲ ಉತ್ಪಾದನೆ ಹೆಚ್ಚಾಗುವುದೋ ಅದರ ಪ್ರಕಾರ ಭಾರತದ ಪಾಲಿಗೂ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಕಚ್ಚಾ ತೈಲ ಸಿಗಲಿದೆ ಎಂದು ಹೇಳಲಾಗುತ್ತಿದೆ. 2025 ರ ವೇಳೆಗಾಗಲೇ ಆಯಿಲ್ ಫೀಲ್ಡ್ ನಲ್ಲಿನ ಕಚ್ಚಾ ತೈಲದ ಉತ್ಪಾದನೆ ಪ್ರತಿದಿನ 4.5 ಲಕ್ಷ ಬ್ಯಾರೆಲ್ ಕ್ಕೇರಲಿದೆ ಅನ್ನುತ್ತವೆ ಅಲ್ಲಿನ ತೈಲ ಸಂಸ್ಥೆಗಳು.
ಅಷ್ಟಕ್ಕೂ ಅಬುಧಾಬಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ತೈಲ ಭೂಮಿ ಖರೀದಿಸಿದ ONGC ಇಂಟರ್ನ್ಯಾಷನಲ್ ಲಿಮಿಟೆಡ್ ಯಾರು?
ಭಾರತದ ಸರಕಾರಿ ಸ್ವಾಮ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿರುವ ONGC, ಇಂಡಿಯನ್ ಆಯಿಲ್ ಹಾಗು ಭಾರತ್ ಪೆಟ್ರೋಲಿಯಂ ಮೂರು ಸಂಸ್ಥೆ ಒಕ್ಕೂಟವೇ ಈ ONGC ಇಂಟರ್ನ್ಯಾಷನಲ್ ಲಿಮಿಟೆಡ್. ಈ ಒಕ್ಕೂಟ ಭಾರತ ಸರ್ಕಾರದ್ದೇ ಆಗಿದೆ.

ಪೆಟ್ರೋಲ್ ಡೀಸೆಲ್ ದರಗಳಲ್ಲಾಗಲಿವೆ ಭಾರಿ ಬದಲಾವಣೆ:
ಕಚ್ಚಾ ತೈಲದ ಕುರಿತು ಮೋದಿಜೀ ಅಬುಧಾಬಿಯ ತೈಲ ಕಂಪೆನಿಗಳ ಜೊತೆಗೆ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡ ಒಪ್ಪಂದ ದಿಂದಾಗಿ ಭಾರತದಲ್ಲಿ ಪೆಟ್ರೋಲ್ ಡೀಸೆಲ್ ಬೆಲೆಗಳಲ್ಲೂ ಭಾರೀ ಬದಲಾವಣೆಯಾಗುವ ಸಂಭವವಿದೆ ಎಂದೇ ಹೇಳಲಾಗುತ್ತಿದೆ.
ಮೊದಲು ಜೋರ್ಡನ್, ನಂತರ ಫಿಲಿಸ್ತೀನ್ ಹಾಗು ಈಗ ಅಬುಧಾಬಿಯಿಂದ ಪ್ರಧಾನಿ ಮೋದಿಯವರನ್ನ ಭರ್ಜರಿಯಾಗಿ ತಮ್ಮ ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರಗಳಿಗೆ ಬರಮಾಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳಲಾಗಿತ್ತು. ಇದನ್ನ ಕಂಡ ಭಾರತ ವಿರೋಧಿ ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರಗಳು ಈಗಾಗಲೇ ದಂಗುಬಡಿದಂತವರಾಗಿದ್ದು ಮುಂದೆ ನಮ್ಮ ಗತಿಯೇನು ಅನ್ನುವ ಚಿಂತೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಬರ್ನಲ್ ಮೊರೆ ಹೋಗಿದ್ದಾರೆ.
ಇಂದು ಅಮೇರಿಕಾ ಹಿಡಿದು ರಷ್ಯಾ, ಇಸ್ರೇಲ್ ಹಾಗು ಅರಬ್ ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರಗಳೂ ಕೂಡ ಪ್ರಧಾನಿ ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನ ಹಾಡಿ‌ ಹೊಗಳುತ್ತಿರೋದು ಕೇವಲ ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನ, ಚೀನಾಕ್ಕೆ ಮಾತ್ರವಲ್ಲ ಭಾರತದಲ್ಲಿ ಮೋದಿ ವಿರೋಧಿಗಳಿಗೂ ನುಂಗಲಾರದ ತುತ್ತಾಗಿ ಮೋದಿ ಕಾಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ ಅಂದರೆ ತಪ್ಪಾಗಲಾರದು.
ಪ್ರಧಾನಿ ಮೋದಿಯವರ ವರ್ಚಸ್ಸನ್ನ ಮನಗಂಡದ್ದಕ್ಕೇ ಇತಿಹಾಸದಲ್ಲಿ ಮೊದಲ ಬಾರಿಗೆ ಅಬುಧಾಬಿ ಭಾರತದ ತೈಲ ಕಂಪೆನಿಗಳಿಗೆ ತನ್ನ ಆಯಿಲ್ ಫೀಲ್ಡ್ ನಲ್ಲಿ ತೈಲ ಉತ್ಪಾದಿಸಲು ಜಾಗ ಕೊಟ್ಟಿದೆ.
67 ವರ್ಷ ಇಲ್ಲಿನ ಭ್ರಷ್ಟ ಸರ್ಕಾರಗಳು ಮಾಡದ ಕೆಲಸವನ್ನ ಮೋದಿ ಕೇವಲ 4 ವರ್ಷಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಮಾಡಿ ತೋರಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ.
ಮೋದಿ ಬರೀ ದೇಶ ವಿದೇಶ ಸುತ್ತುತ್ತಾರೆ, ಅವರೊಬ್ಬ NRI ಪ್ರಧಾನಿ ಅಂತ ಹೀಗಳೆಯುವ ಕಮಂಗಿಗಳಿಗೆ ಮೋದಿ ಅಬುಧಾಬಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡು ಬಂದ ಈ ಪೆಟ್ರೋಲಿಯಂ ಡೀಲ್ ನ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಗೊತ್ತಿದ್ದರೂ ತುಟಿಕ್ ಪಿಟಿಕ್ ಅನ್ನುತ್ತಿಲ್ಲವಲ್ಲ, ಇದರಿಂದ ಅವರು ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನ ಅದೆಷ್ಟು ದ್ವೇಷಿಸುತ್ತರೆ ಅನ್ನೋದು ಇಲ್ಲೇ ಅರ್ಥವಾಗುತ್ತೆ ನೋಡಿ.
ಭಾರತಕ್ಕೆ ದಿಟ್ಟೆದೆಯ ಲಾಲಬಹದ್ದೂರ್ ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜೀ, ಅದ್ಭುತ ಆಡಳಿತಗಾರ,‌ ವಾಕ್ ಚಾತುರ್ಯ ಹೊಂದಿದ್ದ ಅಟಲ್ ಬಿಹಾರಿ ವಾಜಪೇಯಿಯವರ ಸಮಾಗಮವಾದ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿ ನರೇಂದ್ರ ಮೋದಿಯವರ ರೂಪದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಿಕ್ಕಿದ್ದಾರೆ.  ಹೌದು ಮೋದಿ 5 ವರ್ಷಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ‌ಕೆಲ ಕೆಲಸಗಳು ಮಾಡುವಲ್ಲಿ ಸಂಪೂರ್ಣವಾಗಿ ಯಶಸ್ವಿಯಾಗಿರದಿರಬಹುದು ಆದರೆ ಪ್ರಾಮಾಣಿಕ ಪ್ರಯತ್ನವಂತೂ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ.
ದೇಶದ 130 ಕೋಟಿ ಜನರ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಯನ್ನ ಥಟ್ಟಂತ ಬಗೆಹರಿಸೋಕೆ ಸಾಧ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ, ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ಸಮವಾದರೂ ಬೇಕಲ್ಲವೆ? ಸ್ವಾತಂತ್ರ್ಯ ಬಂದಾಗಿನಿಂದ ಭಾರತವನ್ನ ಅಗೆದು ತೋಡಿ ಲೂಟಿ ಮಾಡಿದ ತಗ್ಗನ್ನ ಮೋದಿ ಮುಚ್ಚಲು ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ಕಾಲಾವಕಾಶವಾದರೂ ಬೇಕಲ್ಲವೇ?
ಭರವಸೆಯಿರಲಿ ಮೋದಿಜೀಯ ಮೇಲೆ!!
ನಾವು ಪ್ರಧಾನಿ ಮೋದಿಯವರ ಜೊತೆಗಿದ್ದೇವೆ, ನೀವು?

ಒಬ್ಬ ಮಲಯಾಳಿ ನಾ ತಂದು ಅವನನ್ನು ಹೊತ್ತು ಮೆರೆದು....
ಅವನನ್ನು ಶಾಸಕನ ಮಾಡಿ 
ಅವರಿಂದಲೇ ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರು ಏಟು ತಿಂತಿವಿ ಅಂದ್ರೆ ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರದು ಎಂತ ಪರಿಸ್ಥಿತಿ..

ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಒದೆ ತಿಂದು ಮಲಗಿದ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿ ವಿದ್ವತ್ ಯಾರು? 
ಆತನನ್ನು ಸಾವು ಬದುಕಿನ ಶಯ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಮಲಗಿಸಿ ನಾನೇ ಪ್ರಿನ್ಸ್ ಅಂತ ಕೊಚ್ಚಿ ಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತಿರುವ  ಈ ನಲಪಾಡ್ ಯಾರು? 
ಕೇಳಿದರೆ ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರ ರಕ್ತ ಕುದ್ದು ಹೋಗುತ್ತೆ ..😡
ಇಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಜವಾದ ಮೈಸೂರು ಧಿವಾನ ರಾಜ ಮನೆತನಕ್ಕೆ ಸೇರಿದ ಶ್ರೀ ಶೇಷಾದ್ರಿ ಅಯ್ಯರ್ ರವರ ಕುಡಿಯೇ ಈ ವಿಧ್ವತ್😳. ನಮ್ಮ ನಾಡಿನ ಮುಖ್ಯ ಮಂತ್ರಿಗಳು ವಾಸ ಮಾಡುವ ಕುಮಾರ ಕೃಪ ಭಂಗಲೆ ಈ ವಿಧ್ವತ್ ವಂಶದ ಧಾನ ಬಿಕ್ಷೆ...ಮೊಟ್ಟ ಮೊದಲ ಬಾರಿಗೆ ಬೆಂಗಳೂರಿಗೆ ಕರೆಂಟು ಬೆಳಕು ಕೊಟ್ಟ ಮನೆತನದ ಕೊಡುಗೆ.
 ಇವತ್ತಿನ ಲಾಲ್ ಭಾಗ್ ಕೋಲಾರ್ ಚಿನ್ನದ ಗಣಿ ಕಬ್ಬನ್ ಪಾರ್ಕ್. ವಿಕ್ಟೋರಿಯಾ ಹಾಸ್ಪಿಟಲ್ ಈ ತರಹದ ಹತ್ತಾರು ಕೊಡುಗೆಗಳನ್ನು ಈ ಸಮಾಜಕ್ಕೆ ಕೊಟ್ಟ ನಿಜವಾದ ಪ್ರಿನ್ಸ್ ಈ ವಿಧ್ವತ್.. ಇವತ್ತು ನಮ್ಮ ಸರಕಾರ ಕಾನೂನು ಎಲ್ಲಾ ವ್ಯವಸ್ತೆ ಸೇರಿ ಕೋಮ ಸ್ಥಿತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಆತನನ್ನು ಮಲಗಿಸಿ ಕಣ್ ಕಣ್ ಬಿಟ್ಕಂಡು ನೋಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇವೇ. 
ಹಾಗಾದರೆ, ಈ ನಲಪಾಡ್ ಯಾರು ಗೊತ್ತೇ? ಯಾವುದೋ ಹೊಟ್ಟೆ ಪಾಡಿಗೆ ಕೇರಳದಿಂದ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕಕ್ಕೆ ಬಂದು ರಾಜಕೀಯ ಮಾಡಿ ನಮ್ಮ ತೇರಿಗೆ ಹಣ ಮತ್ತು ಜನರನ್ನು ಸುಲಿಗೆ ಮಾಡಿ ತಮ್ಮ ಖಜಾನೆ ತುಂಬಿಸಿಕೊಂಡು ನಮ್ಮನ್ನೇ ಕಚ್ಚಲು ಬರುತ್ತಿದ್ದುದು ವಿಪರ್ಯಾಸ. ಈತ ತನ್ನನ್ನು ತಾನು ಪ್ರಿನ್ಸ್ ಮೊಹಮ್ಮದ್ ಎಂದು ಪರಿಚಯಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತಿದ್ದಾನೆ. ಬೆಂಗಳೂರಿನ ಅತೀ ದೋಡ್ಡ ಶ್ರೀಮಂತ ಕ್ಷೇತ್ರ ಶಾಂತಿ ನಗರ. ಅದು ಇವನ ಅಡ್ಡ.  ಆ ಕ್ಷೇತ್ರದಲ್ಲಿ ಬರುವ ಶ್ರೀಮಂತ ಹೋಟಲ್ ಕ್ಲಬ್ ಪಬ್ ಮತ್ತು ಈ ಪೊಲಿಸ್ ಸ್ಟೇಷನ್ ಗಳಿಂದಲೂ ಮಾಮುಲು ಕೋಟ್ಯಾಂತರ ರೂಪಾಯಿಗಳ ಹಫ್ತಾ ವಸೂಲಿ ಮಾಡುವ ಗೂಂಡಾ.. ಇವತ್ತು ಮೀಡೀಯಗಳ ಕೈಗೆ ಸಿಕ್ಕಿ ಬಯಲಾದ ಕಾರಣಕ್ಕೆ ಕೇಸು ಹಾಕಿದ್ದಾರಷ್ಟೆ. ಈ ನಾಯಿ ಪರವಾಗಿ ಕೋರ್ಟ ನಲ್ಲಿ ವಾದ ಮಾಡಿತ್ತಿರುವ ವಕೀಲರಿಗೆ ಜಾತಿ ಪ್ರೀತಿ. ನಲಪಾಡ್ ಹಲ್ಲೆ ಮಾಡಿರೋದಕ್ಕೆ ಸಾಕ್ಷಿಯೇ ಇಲ್ಲ ರಾಜಕೀಯ ಒತ್ತಾಯಕ್ಕೆ ಮಣಿದು 307 ಕೇಸು ಹಾಕಲಾಗಿದೆ ಅಂತ ಬೊಬ್ಬೆ ಹೊಡೆಯುತಿದ್ದಾನೆ. 

ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು ಇದನ್ನು ಷೇರ್ ಮಾಡಿ ಪ್ರತಿಯೊಬ್ಬ ಕನ್ನಡಿಗನಿಗೂ ಸತ್ಯ ಗೊತ್ತಾಗಲಿ.
ಕನ್ನಡ ಸಂಘಟನೆಗಳು ವಿಧ್ವತ್ ಕುಟುಂಬಕ್ಕೆ ನ್ಯಾಯ ಕೊಡಿಸಲಿ.
ಹ್ಯಾರಿಸ್ ನನ್ನು ರಾಜಕೀಯದಿಂದ ಮತ್ತು ಕರ್ನಾಟಕದಿಂದ ಒದ್ದೋಡಿಸಲಿ...

13/03/18, 12:50 PM - Vishak: In 1998, Kodak employed 1,70,000 employees and sold 85% of the world's photo papers. Within the last few years, digital photography made them out of the market. Kodak went bankrupt and all his staff came on the road. .

HMT (clock)
BAJAJ (scooter)
DYNORA (TV)
MURPHY (radio)
NOKIA (Mobile)
RAJDOOT (bike)
AMBASDOR (car)

Friends,
There was no shortage of quality at all, yet they were out of the market !!
reason???
They have not changed over time. !!

You have an idea that in the coming 10 years, the world will change completely and 70 to 90% of the people running today will be closed.

Welcome to the 4th Industrial Revolution ...

Uber is just a software. He does not have a single car of his own, despite this he is the world's largest taxi company.

Airbnb is the world's largest hotel company, while they do not have a single hotel of their own.

There are many examples like paytm, ola cabs, oyo rooms.

There is no work left for young lawyers in the US now because the software named IBM Watson gives better legal advice throughout the moment. In the next 10 years, 90% of Americans will become unemployed ... who will save 10% ... they will be Super Specialists.

The software named Watson is diagnosed with 4x Accuracy of Cancer compared to humans. By 2030 the computer will be more intelligent than humans.

By 2018, Driverless cars will land on the roads. By 2020, this single invention will start to change the whole world.

90% cars will disappear from the streets of the world in the next 10 years ... Those who will survive will either have electric cars or hybrid ... roads will be empty, consumption of petrol will decrease by 90%, all Arab countries will become bankrupt .

You will request a car from a software like Uber and in a few moments, a driverless car will be parked at your door ... if you share it with someone, that ride will be cheaper than your bike.

Due to being a driverless of cars, 99% of accidents will stop. This will stop the business of Car Insurance.

No employment like a driver will survive on earth. When 90% cars will disappear from cities and roads, problems like Traffic and Parking will end automatically ... because a car will be equal to 20 cars today.

From today 5 or 10 years ago, there was no such place where there is no PCO. Then when the mobile phone came in all the pockets, the PCO started to shut down. Then all the PCO people started selling the phone again. Now the recharge is also going on line.

Have you ever noticed ..?

Nowadays every third store in the market is now mobile phone.
sale, service, recharge, accessories, repair, maintenance.

Now all is done by Paytm .. Now people have started booking railway tickets with their phones. Now the transaction of money is also changing. Currency Note was replaced by Plastic Money and now Digital becomes Transactions are

The world is changing very fast .. Keep the eye ears nose open or else you will lose ...

Prepare to change over time.

Hence...
The person should continue to make changes in his business and his nature over time.
 
"Time to Time Update & Upgrade"

Run with time and get Success✌

20/03/18, 6:32 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: That's why Devegowda kicked him out
20/03/18, 6:32 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: He divided Gowda as Kuruba Gowda something
20/03/18, 6:32 PM - Vishak: If lingayats get reservations then they will vote man

20/03/18, 6:42 PM - Vishak: But ya lingayats is little uncessary as they pray Shiva which is closer to Hindus and not like they pray Buddha, mahaveer or guru gobind
20/03/18, 6:42 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: ಛಿದ್ರಾಮಯ್ಯ
20/03/18, 6:44 PM - Vishak: Only thing difference is they don't follow Varna system
20/03/18, 6:44 PM - Anni jss: What does Varna system means?
20/03/18, 6:44 PM - Lola Infosys: Actually who is he to divide? Did lingayats actually ask this?

20/03/18, 6:53 PM - Vishak: U can marry for sure
20/03/18, 6:54 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Panda forgot SWAYAMVARA used to happen in earlier days
20/03/18, 6:56 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Aryans created Varnas, British created casts, Congress creating sub casts 😂

No freedom to secularism😜
20/03/18, 7:29 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: ವಿಜಯ್ ಮಲ್ಯ ನಿಗೆ ಸಾಲ ಕೊಟ್ಟಿದ್ದು ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್

ನೀರವ್ ಮೋದಿಗೆ ಸಾಲ ಕೊಟ್ಟಿದ್ದು ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್

PNB ಹಗರಣ ಶುರು ಆಗಿದ್ದು 2011ರಲ್ಲಿ
ಅವಾಗ ಇದ್ದಿದ್ದು ಮನ್ಮೋಹನ್ ಸಿಂಗ್ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಸರ್ಕಾರ

ಆದರೆ ಆರೋಪ ಬಂದಿದ್ದು ನರೇಂದ್ರಮೋದಿ ಮೇಲೆ 👌🏼👏
20/03/18, 7:34 PM - Anni jss: Haha
20/03/18, 7:34 PM - Anni jss: True.
20/03/18, 7:35 PM - Anni jss: Ppl don't understand who gave loans to fraudsters.
20/03/18, 7:40 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: 500 ವರ್ಷ ಮೊಘಲ್ ಆಳಿದ್ರು
200 ವರ್ಷ ಬ್ರಿಟಿಷ್ ಆಳಿದ್ರು
ಆಮೇಲೆ 70 ವರ್ಷ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಅಳ್ತಿದ್ರು

ಆದ್ರೂ ಕೆಲವು ಜನ ಹೇಳ್ತಾರೆ BJP ಮತ್ತು RSS, ದಲಿತರು ಮತ್ತೆ ಮುಸ್ಲಿಮರನ್ನು ಉದ್ಧಾರ ಮಾಡಲ್ಲ ಅಂತ 🤨

ಆದರೆ, ನೆನಪಿರಲಿ BJP ಸರ್ಕಾರದಲ್ಲೇ ಕೋವಿಂದ್ ಮತ್ತು ಕಲಾಂ ದೇಶದ ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರಪತಿಗಳಾಗಿದ್ದು
20/03/18, 7:43 PM - Anni jss: Panda want to tell just something. Not to create argument or something.. many days back u were accusing bjp and RSS that they are doing caste politics, hindutva and all. But this lingayat is perfect example that it's Congress which is doing caste politics by dividing the society.
Hope u are able to differentiate and get a clarity
20/03/18, 7:49 PM - Vishak: According to me all do politics
20/03/18, 7:49 PM - Vishak: On caste and religion
20/03/18, 7:50 PM - Vishak: But for the moment this was very bad move from Congress
20/03/18, 7:51 PM - Vishak: Even if lingayats are happy with this decision it's wrong
20/03/18, 7:52 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: They are not happy, only those foolish MATHA swami people will be benefited
20/03/18, 7:52 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: And people will listen to swamis🤦🏼‍♂

24/03/18, 2:21 PM - Vishak: U r just telling Congress did tat Congress did this
24/03/18, 2:21 PM - Vishak: They are not in power
24/03/18, 2:22 PM - Vishak: Moreover most states are bjp ruled states
24/03/18, 2:22 PM - Vishak: So u can't say Congress vnot co operating
24/03/18, 2:23 PM - Vishak: They gave chance to BJP in past also but because of stupid agendas they never get elected
24/03/18, 2:23 PM - Vishak: Finally in 2014 their agenda was development
24/03/18, 2:24 PM - Vishak: So ppl gave chance
24/03/18, 2:25 PM - Anni jss: They have not looted the country
24/03/18, 2:26 PM - Anni jss: That's what I like. Modi is not corrupt like congis, that's y I vote for him. Gdp even after demonetization, GST is more than upa times.. that's y I vote for him
24/03/18, 2:27 PM - Anni jss: I vote for this
24/03/18, 2:28 PM - Anni jss: I vote him for strenthning the armed forces which were neglected during upa. But still it needs to be strengthened
24/03/18, 2:29 PM - Anni jss: I vote him for his surgical strikes teaching Pak a lesson and giving a taste of their own medicine and not sit quiet like MMS
24/03/18, 2:30 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: When did people gave chance to BJP ?? This is only the second term.

70 years Congress fucked entire India.
24/03/18, 2:31 PM - Anni jss: I vote him for the global image that's built bcos of him. Under upa, India was neglected. Cos of this limelight, other countries will be interested in India.. could be interested in anything. Could it be investment, just taking a tour of India or anything
24/03/18, 2:32 PM - Anni jss: Yeah.. Congress with absolute power for 65-70yrs could have done wonders..
24/03/18, 2:32 PM - Anni jss: And everyone asks what modi did in 4-5yrs..
24/03/18, 2:32 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: It will be foolish if not to think about future plans, 

Of course BJP should have some forthcoming leader, it shouldn't end with Namo.

Definitely he is better than ONE FAMILY which is destroying india from years.
24/03/18, 2:33 PM - Anni jss: I vote modi over Rahul, for the sole reason, modi has experience of running a state for 3-4 terms and a country for a term. Rahul has nil
24/03/18, 2:34 PM - Anni jss: U have to appreciate. It was modi, now Yogi, Tomo somebody else.. but in Congress, it's only been one family
24/03/18, 2:34 PM - Anni jss: 😂😂
24/03/18, 2:35 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Additionally, BJP is alliance force, not one single family has control over.
If I want to vote for Congress, Gandhi family must quit.
24/03/18, 2:35 PM - Anni jss: In Congress is only respect Lal bahadur shastri, old members of Congress like sardar Patel, PV Narasimha Rao, pranab mukherjee
24/03/18, 2:36 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Ani you know, Congress present themselves as Dalit supporters but when Ambedkar died they did not give permission to bury him next to Nehru
24/03/18, 2:36 PM - Anni jss: Ohhh this I didn't know
24/03/18, 2:37 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: It's true, that's why Ambedkar memorial somewhere else

24/03/18, 2:39 PM - Vishak: Has so many cases on him
24/03/18, 2:39 PM - Vishak: Video evidence that he spreads communal hatred
24/03/18, 2:39 PM - Anni jss: Rahul also has.. national herald both Sonia and Rahul were given bail
24/03/18, 2:40 PM - Anni jss: U believe in video against bjp. But u don't believe in evidence which is pro bjp 😂😂 nice hypocrisy
24/03/18, 2:40 PM - Vishak: Guru Congress and bjp both are corrupt
24/03/18, 2:40 PM - Anni jss: Could be, but bjp is less corrupt
24/03/18, 2:41 PM - Vishak: I don't like bip because vthey are harming communal harmony
24/03/18, 2:41 PM - Vishak: Also they are looting ppl
24/03/18, 2:41 PM - Anni jss: Why don't u appreciate Yogi's action against hardcore criminals?

24/03/18, 2:44 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lingayat vs Veerashaiva isn't that communal ?

When Ambedkar left Congress in 1951, still posing as Dalit supporters, it's also communal
24/03/18, 2:44 PM - Vishak: Ya I was with u right for that
24/03/18, 2:44 PM - Vishak: See I m not any dalit supporter and all
24/03/18, 2:45 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Kashmir problem was not solved yet it's because of Nehru

24/03/18, 2:48 PM - Anni jss: Cos party started a start up.. cos Congress was age old party... Cos Congress had brains washed as if they are the ones responsible for freedom
24/03/18, 2:48 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Yes, fools. That why the suffering now
24/03/18, 2:48 PM - Vishak: Waa ok can't u see different of India after independent and now

25/03/18, 12:33 PM - Anni jss: Let them teach about all dynasties but why limit to only Christianity and Islam
25/03/18, 12:34 PM - Vishak: Lo guru seriously
25/03/18, 12:34 PM - Vishak: Hinduism is aged old religion
25/03/18, 12:34 PM - Vishak: It was not formed during 1st century AD
25/03/18, 12:34 PM - Vishak: How can u teach it
25/03/18, 12:35 PM - Vishak: How can u include in history
25/03/18, 12:35 PM - Anni jss: Y u can't? Basic principles? I am telling to teach Vedas or upanishads
25/03/18, 12:35 PM - Vishak: Who is reading Quran in history
25/03/18, 12:35 PM - Anni jss: How could Islam or Christianity be included?
25/03/18, 12:35 PM - Vishak: Or bible
25/03/18, 12:35 PM - Vishak: Y to read Vedas and upanishads doesn't make any sense
25/03/18, 12:36 PM - Anni jss: Birth of Hinduism, impact of Hinduism on Hindustan. Keep these as  chapters..
25/03/18, 12:36 PM - Anni jss: Correct I am not telling to teach Vedas or upanishads.
25/03/18, 12:37 PM - Vishak: Lo tats wat it's aged old religion
25/03/18, 12:37 PM - Vishak: Nobody has any evidence of how it started
25/03/18, 12:37 PM - Vishak: If ter was it would have been taught
25/03/18, 12:37 PM - Vishak: Same with Roman
25/03/18, 12:38 PM - Vishak: But from childhood only we learn ramayana Mahabharata
25/03/18, 12:38 PM - Vishak: Already our parents teach who all our God's are
25/03/18, 12:39 PM - Vishak: In different languages we learn stories related god
25/03/18, 12:39 PM - Vishak: So u think ter is enuff
25/03/18, 12:40 PM - Vishak: But one think I agree they don't teach Kamasutra, and dark secerts of Hinduism which generally not taught during childhood
25/03/18, 12:41 PM - Vishak: Tat I think can bed added by 8th
25/03/18, 12:41 PM - Vishak: But in small curriculum I doubt they will add
25/03/18, 12:42 PM - Vishak: It's only by 11, 12 u can learn I.guess
25/03/18, 12:43 PM - Vishak: But at least a mention of these terms would be good to make students firstly curious, secondly not b ashamed of speaking
25/03/18, 12:44 PM - Anni jss: That's why it's called sanatana Dharma. If they want they can write as, nobody knows who founded it. It's sanatana Dharma. But why don't want to write that or about Hinduism is, they will lose vote, vote bank
25/03/18, 12:44 PM - Anni jss: I am not asking history book to teach Vedas or upanishads in detail. Let them mention to the amount to which Islam or Christianity is done..
25/03/18, 12:45 PM - Anni jss: I don't support teaching Vedas or upanishads in schools, cos ppl from different faith will be there.
25/03/18, 12:46 PM - Anni jss: If we teach Vedas to all, it will be like forcibly teaching to ppl from different faiths
25/03/18, 12:46 PM - Vishak: I think mention of Vedas and upanishads are ter
25/03/18, 12:46 PM - Vishak: During the Aryan and dravidian raise chapters I heard these things
25/03/18, 12:46 PM - Anni jss: If u mention and teach religions, mention about all, else don't mention or teach anything
25/03/18, 12:47 PM - Vishak: No Islam and Christianity was newly formed religion
25/03/18, 12:47 PM - Anni jss: U might have heard in harappa and mohenjodaro chapters.. not in a dedicated chapter about hinduism
25/03/18, 12:47 PM - Anni jss: Illa anta yaar heludru guru
25/03/18, 12:48 PM - Vishak: Dude thing is Hinduism is more a culture than religion
25/03/18, 12:48 PM - Vishak: It's not like one god thing
25/03/18, 12:48 PM - Anni jss: A religion has a culture.. culture is part of religion
25/03/18, 12:48 PM - Vishak: Most of new religions are based on one god
25/03/18, 12:48 PM - Anni jss: Ok let them teach the same thing
25/03/18, 12:49 PM - Vishak: Buddhism, Islam or Christianity

25/03/18, 12:50 PM - Anni jss: Lo krishna contest was not part of history
25/03/18, 12:50 PM - Vishak: They will start making assumptions
25/03/18, 12:50 PM - Anni jss: Ped ped.. I am telling to teach Hinduism as part of history
25/03/18, 12:50 PM - Vishak: They must read entire books

25/03/18, 12:52 PM - Vishak: Ter are lot of debates for wats is right and wrong
25/03/18, 12:52 PM - Vishak: For eg one question always comes to our mind y did Rama take test of sita after returning from Lanka
25/03/18, 12:52 PM - Vishak: It has different versions of answer
25/03/18, 12:53 PM - Vishak: It's very complicated

28/03/18, 7:57 PM - Lola Infosys: An old nun who was living in a convent next to a construction site noticed the coarse language of the workers and decided to spend some time with them to correct their ways. She decided she would take her lunch, sit with the workers and talk with them. She put her sandwich in a brown bag and walked over to the spot where the men were eating. She walked up to the group and with a big smile asked, "Do you men know Jesus Christ?" They shook their heads and looked at each other. One of the workers looked up into the steelwork and yelled, "Anybody up there know Jesus Christ?" One of the steelworkers asked why. The worker yelled, "His wife is here with his lunch".

01/04/18, 2:32 PM - Lola Infosys: Let me be blunt event if it hurts you. Hindus are biggest morons and maybe to some extent deserve to be extinct. 

You know why - because it’s not like they have been taken by surprise or subterfuge. They have enemies who have made their intent extremely open and clear at every level for a thousand plus god dammed years - not just a decade or two. 

Even after that 1000 years of very clear intent - Hindus somehow survived by fluke. And instead of consolidating that fluke survival and strengthening themselves like the Jews - the Hindus did something ridiculous - they just voluntarily made it more difficult for themselves by voting all wrong and instilling destructive values in their progeny. 

Result is as follows and remember in a democracy you are totally responsible for your political fate 👇🏼👇🏼

Modi has to get 282 to become PM.
Rahul can become PM even at 120.

Modi has to remove RTE, kill anti Hindu discrimination, and destroy  judicial apartheid, to get Hindu votes.
Rahul gets Hindu votes by going to five temples.

Modi has to manage NPAs, make the GDP growth rate touch 8.5%, and implement GST perfectly to become PM.
While Rahul Gandhi can have Indian economy be managed by Chidambaram.

Modi has to end TB By 2022, bring short time Ayushman Bharat, bring about Mission Indradhanush and open AIIMS in all states, to become PM.
Rahul can simply connect all MRIs for this.

Modi has to stop Bangladeshi, Rohingya infiltration, throw back those already here, and implement Citizen Registry.
Rahul has to understand that Rohingyas exist.

Married couple at a Zoo walks past a gorilla enclosure.

Says the woman: 'Mark, Do you know that gorillas are the only animals which resemble men in their behavior?

Look, seeing that no one is looking, I'll expose one of my breasts 2 it & see how horny it gets just as men do.'

Mary then exposes one of her breasts, and, sure enough the gorilla gets excited and grabs the bars of the enclosure as if it wanted to break free.

'See,' says the woman, 'Now, I know why you react the way you do; men can't control their animal instincts just like gorillas can't.'

Says Mark: 'Now expose both breasts and let us see what happens.'

The woman exposes both breasts to the gorilla and it gets very excited and is now desperately trying to escape from the enclosure.

Says Mark: 'This is incredible, now, pull your skirt up, turn around and expose your bum and let us see what happens!'
 
The woman pulls her skirt up, turns around with her bum to the gorilla, which by now ,was extremely aroused, breaks free from the enclosure, grabs the woman and starts yanking the clothes off her.

The woman yells: 'Mark , what do I do now? Please, help me!'

Mark replies: 'Now, tell him you have a headache and you're not in mood ... Let us see if Gorillas and Men are the same..😝😂

05/04/18, 6:04 PM - Anni jss: I meant, none of the political parties have worked or concerned for the upliftment of poor brahmins. So we cannot choose anybody if people think only about themselves

05/04/18, 6:10 PM - Vishak: Great😃
05/04/18, 6:10 PM - Vishak: But y I suggested is many upper caste poor ppl don't get education because of reservation
05/04/18, 6:10 PM - Vishak: So u can help them out
05/04/18, 6:11 PM - Anni jss: True. But that's the teaching of Hinduism. Treat everyone equally
05/04/18, 6:12 PM - Anni jss: That's why Hinduism, sanatana Dharma is called great
05/04/18, 6:12 PM - Anni jss: But same thing has been used for political purposes
05/04/18, 6:13 PM - Vishak: I feel we must unite Hindus end casteism and remove reservation based on caste rather than that it must economy but it needs support from both sides
05/04/18, 6:14 PM - Anni jss: It's just not needed for Hindus, but for the whole humanity
05/04/18, 6:14 PM - Anni jss: But nobody wants to solve problems.
05/04/18, 6:15 PM - Vishak: Ya

05/04/18, 8:30 PM - Anni jss: Experience the beauty of Mt. Everest at night in this time-lapse by Candian photographer Elia Saikaly. While most climbers slept, he attempted to capture some of the magic.
In his words, ‘‘these Time Lapse Images were captured as high as 6200 metres (Camp 2) above sea level on Mt. Everest. We slept at 6000 metres for three consecutive nights on the summit of Mt. Lobuche East waiting for a glimpse of Everest from that vantage point. Around 11pm on the 2nd night, the skies opened up and the top of the world revealed herself in all of her glory. No where else on the planet have I ever seen the Milky Way so clear, so vivid and so very much alive. It takes a great deal of discipline to stay up all night capturing the magic for the world to experience. Cameras freeze. Shutters freeze. Batteries freeze. Humans freeze. The high altitude environment is debilitating at best. Your body is taking a constant beating by the low levels of oxygen in the atmosphere. The higher you climb, the worse this becomes.
‘‘And yet, this is heaven on Earth for me. This is where I feel alive. This is where the combination of my love for imagery, astrophotography, storytelling and connection with the mountains all intersect. It’s my oxygen. It energizes me. And keeps me in a flow state. My tribute to Everest In Time Lapse.’’

Ms. Doris: "We are not ignoring them; they are considered silent." ...!!
(I was even more confused.....😏🙅😱😵....??)

During the lunch break, MS. Doris gave me her packed 
lunch & asked me to heat it in the cafeteria.

I ate all the food and returned her an empty container....!!😏

Ms. Doris:---- "What happened, I told you to go and HEAT my food & you are returning me an empty container??"

Me: --- ".Madam I thought 'H' was silent"

12/04/18, 4:25 PM - Anni jss: Given below are some unimportant ordinary news from last week. Please feel free to correct if anyone of them is wrong. 
5 most important news of *national importance* that have immensely strong influence on the course of the nation & discussed 24x7 by media in last one week:
1. Salman Khan Jail/Bail.
2. IPL
3. Kapil Sharma abuse.
4. Taimur had some digestion problem
5. Shilpa Shetty went for a dinner date with her husband.....

Now, a few pieces of irrelevant news which are of no importance & hence, deserve to be printed as a side column somewhere in the middle pages of a newspaper.
After all, these news will neither sell nor create sensation. More importantly, don't fit into the agenda of media houses.

1. *Direct tax collection increased by almost 20% as compared to the last year.* After this unprecedented growth, tax collections are *₹10,05,000 crore.*

2. *₹4,00,000 crore* of NPAs (bad loans) have returned to the banks. The total amount of bad loans was ₹9,00,000 crore & almost half of it has come back to banking system due to Insolvency & Bankruptcy code.

3. The Budget session of Parliament ended in a complete washout, causing a loss of ₹360 crore. The amount the nation lost due to *disruptive politics of opposition* is more than the infrastructure budget on border areas.

4. India constructed *10,000 km of highways* in the financial year 2017-18, which came to an end on 31 March. *The target for next year is an ambitious 15,000 km* Ministry of Roadways said.

5. CBI starts its inquiry into the *controversial 80:20 Gold scheme,* which was approved all of a sudden by the RBI just a few days before the new government was supposed to be formed on 26 May 2014. *There were loopholes in this scheme which led to the massive scam by Nirav Modi & Mehul Choksi.*

6. In a highly strategic move that will have widespread ramifications & help in countering China, India has announced *a broad gauge rail connectivity between Delhi & Kathmandu (via Raxaul)*

7. e-way (electronic) bills launched for inter-state movement of goods & logistics. This will cut down hurdles & problems of shipping goods between 2 states, which earlier involved severe headache due to long queues on tolls at the state borders.

8. Core sector growth up by 5.5% in February.

The Indian media is deliberately not showing these news. Instead it will continue publishing news about Bharat bandh, Dalit unrest....... some or the other thing intending to suppress our Nation's progress and achievements. Its up to us whether to know & acknowledge the *Truth.*
12/04/18, 4:44 PM - Vishak: There are 100 problems also 😆
12/04/18, 4:45 PM - Vishak: 😆👆🏼

12/04/18, 4:49 PM - Vishak: At least if country was growing I would have not cared all this hindutva and all shit but we are paying more tax with no returns and to face all this shit no way dude. When U r in government u need to solve it in 5 years by hook or crock if not step aside. Other party will also b removed if they don't that's the cycle and it will continue. No way we will give trust to one party and dream acche din 😄

I'm beutral about party
12/04/18, 5:05 PM - Vishak: 😆

12/04/18, 5:07 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: How much tax u were paying in UPA ?
12/04/18, 5:07 PM - Vishak: Obviously less
12/04/18, 5:07 PM - Anni jss: And please check who started Pradhan mantri awaz yojana. It was started by our honorable prime minister, my leader Narendra modiji
12/04/18, 5:08 PM - Anni jss: It was not started by upa or MMS or by any previous govt
12/04/18, 5:08 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: You know in 1950, gold rate was 100 or 200 per gram, in Modi's rule almost 2000rs per gram.

I hate Modi
12/04/18, 5:08 PM - Anni jss: There were 1000 problems in upa govt
12/04/18, 5:09 PM - Anni jss: Panda kisiyadalla, reply for this

12/04/18, 5:10 PM - Vishak: Please laugh
12/04/18, 5:10 PM - Anni jss: Pls read about that yojana. There is no yojana done for 15lk

12/04/18, 5:12 PM - Anni jss: I did not get any benefit from upa as well 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
12/04/18, 5:14 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: There is quote called ಕನ್ನಡ ಪಿಕ್ಟ್ನರ್ ನೋಡದೇನೆ ಬೈಯಿ ಅಂತ

Same applies to BJP.
It's okay that Congress fucked us for 70 years but we still don't want BJP (not even one term)

Because BJP don't work
12/04/18, 5:15 PM - Ba: None I guess, Congress has deep-rooted poverty like anything, we are ready to give chance to bjp for one more term, then we can tally, for 70 years fuckups vs 10 years fuckups
12/04/18, 5:16 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: In almost 70 years of independence Congress could not even provide basic requirement like Toilets, Cleanliness, Bank account, Insurance to people of this country
12/04/18, 5:17 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: for population of 100Cr 7 IITs 7IIM and few AIIMS can that be considered to be achievement so great that all those uncountable scams could be hidden under those?
12/04/18, 5:18 PM - Anni jss: Superb 👆🏼👌🏼👌🏼
12/04/18, 5:18 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Petrol price sas touching 80 per liter, But now its around 60, and government is keeping it a bit high as they need to pay debt built during congress rule
12/04/18, 5:19 PM - Anni jss: MMS says, crores of people in India do not have bank account. What was he doing when he was FM or PM for 30yrs?
12/04/18, 5:19 PM - Ba: Sending SMS
12/04/18, 5:20 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Congress talked about Poverty and tried abolish poor from this land, BJP gave poor chance to be able to enter a Bank and get an 0 balance account
12/04/18, 5:20 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: In congress Leader is by default from Gandhi family, I dont understand what Rahul gandhi has done for nation, for party in order to promote him as a person to be PM, 
12/04/18, 5:21 PM - Ba: The only thing which modi wasn't able to do what he promised was getting black Money, for that u can blame him, but I will give him a couple more years, cos I waited 70 years when Congress was stripping me down
12/04/18, 5:22 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Congress sent black money to foreign and BJP is trying to bring it back.
12/04/18, 5:22 PM - Anni jss: One more benefit. As soon as NDA came to.power in 2014-15, they increased savings from 1lk to 1.5lk. I have been able to save 50k more from 2014 on wards plus getting tax rebate and my taxable income is lil low.
12/04/18, 5:22 PM - Ba: That doesn't matter arun, we are bhakts
12/04/18, 5:23 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I need this clarification, for those who support Congress.

Change Gandhi family, even I will support Congress.
12/04/18, 5:23 PM - Ba: Forget doing anything, what is his agenda if he wins, u ask
12/04/18, 5:24 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: See the below list
12/04/18, 5:24 PM - Ba: Women empowerment?
12/04/18, 5:24 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: All are completed everywhere except Karnataka
12/04/18, 5:24 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: In two years what BJP Did follows:Pro PoorJan Dhan YojanaPandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Shramev Jayate KaryakramDeen Dayal Upadhyaya Antyodaya YojanaMission Housing for allMicro Units Development and Refinance Agency Bank (MUDRA Bank)Pro YouthMy Gov Online PlatformDigital IndiaMake In IndiaDeen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushal YojanaNational Policy for Skill Development and EntrepreneurshipNational Sports Talent Search SchemeSwachh Vidyalaya AbhiyanPadhe Bharat Badhe BharatPandit Madan Mohan Malviya National Mission on Teachers and Teacher TrainingRashtriya Avishkar AbhiyanPro FarmerEnhanced Compensation for distressed Farmers due to crop damageDeen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti YojanaSoil Health Card SchemePradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai YojanaJan Suraksha Schemes (PMJJBY, PMBSY, APY)Rashtriya Gokul MissionCrop InsurancePro WomenBeti Bachao, Beti Padhao AbhiyaanSukanya Samriddhi AccountHimmat AppPAHAL-Direct Benefits Transfer for LPG (DBTL) Consumers SchemeSwachh Bharat MissionGold Monetisation SchemePro Senior CitizenPradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima YojanaPradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima YojanaAtal Pension YojanaPro DevelopmentThe National Institution for Transforming India (NITI AAYOG)Make In IndiaDigital IndiaSmart City ProgrammeThe National Urban Development MissionDeen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti YojanaPragati PlatformMission Housing for all

Compare these with Congress rule and also compare the time frame factor.
12/04/18, 5:24 PM - Anni jss: Upa could have increased  savings from 1lk to 1.5lk long ago. They had ruled for 10yrs, but they did not do
12/04/18, 5:24 PM - Theja: RG is the weakest opponent.
Nobody support rg.
I don't have a reason to vote modi
12/04/18, 5:25 PM - Anni jss: Ok give reasons to vote for others. If u prove others are better than modi, I will vote for that person
12/04/18, 5:26 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I am just taking it for granted that you know how important the Jan dhan yojna, make in India campaign, the pradhan mantri insurance scheme and other similar schemes are.
12/04/18, 5:27 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: The foreign policies were horribly wrong with USA Israel and Russia specially during UPA. Modi called Obama as "barrak" for a reason
12/04/18, 5:28 PM - Theja: We will left only with congress
For me the benefits are negative.
I'm paying more to eat travel. Bjp is pro RSS
12/04/18, 5:28 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: but yes there are a few points that are in favor of the Congress too.
UPA was better at media management... Much smarter at the vote bank politics... A Cabinet that looks more educated (though was not as effective)
And yes BJP is making a few mistakes but you make mistakes when you try hard both for reforms and votes
A few vague statements from a few leaders have been coming all the time I think we should be looking at the bigger picture and not petty issues.
12/04/18, 5:29 PM - Anni jss: So u are back to Rahul Gandhi. He is no match to even kj George or kumaraswamy

12/04/18, 5:34 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Someone wrote this
12/04/18, 5:34 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: In this present scenario:

BJP is led by a dynamic/forward looking man called Narendra Modi who is surrounded by some stupid fringe leaders. 

Congress itself is led by a stupid man calledRahul Gandhi who is surrounded by equally stupid leaders.
12/04/18, 5:34 PM - Vishak: Me n theja I guess Pakka won't modi😁
12/04/18, 5:34 PM - Anni jss: Then discussion about politics will keep on going 😁

12/04/18, 5:35 PM - Ba changed this group's icon
12/04/18, 5:36 PM - Theja: Yes our community votes are gone anti modi.
Around 30 percent.

12/04/18, 5:38 PM - Anni jss: Modi's acche din is better than upa's loot din, scam din, corruption din
12/04/18, 5:39 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: It's a known fact that the stock markets love Modi. As exit poll results started coming in during 9, 12 and 13 of May 2014, the Sensex rose 1,500 points. Over the last three years, though there have been patches of disappointments (the index hit a low of 22951 on 11 February 2016), by and large it has been a dream run. Now, the market is again on record breaking spree. On Friday (19 May), the index hit a record high 30,712.35. As it moved from 24,121.74 (on 16 May 2014) to 30,712, rising 27.3 percent, investor wealth swelled 56 percent or by Rs 45 lakh crore. The BSE market capitalisation is now more than $2 trillion.
12/04/18, 5:39 PM - Vishak: ನೋ
12/04/18, 5:39 PM - Anni jss: U asked what I have got benefitted from bjp/modi. I replied for it. No reply for it theja.

12/04/18, 5:43 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Na kalsid ashtu statement ge ondu answer illa.

13/04/18, 8:09 PM - Anni jss: Killer got caught or not. When gowri was killed why so called laddhijeevis asking modi to answer? It was siddu govt which failed
13/04/18, 8:09 PM - Vishak: U r comparing tat to this rape
13/04/18, 8:09 PM - Anni jss: High profile murder why did siddu govt let it happen?
13/04/18, 8:09 PM - Anni jss: I'm not comparing. I am asking logic of ppl
13/04/18, 8:09 PM - Anni jss: Just a suspect. Not a murderer
13/04/18, 8:11 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Ani don't debate and don't even change the group name.

Comparing one person over a party or religion clearly shows the IQ level of people. Just chill

13/04/18, 9:29 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: They are Mental, 

Like brahmins, Muslims have Moulis.

In Hindusim, you can question, tease the brahmin on his ideology and practice but when it comes to Moulis, if u oppose any rules passed by them, you will be kicked out of religion

13/04/18, 10:04 PM - Lola Infosys: Lol

13/04/18, 10:06 PM - Vishak: Just a wake up call
13/04/18, 10:06 PM - Vishak: See in this case blaming on modi silence is too much
13/04/18, 10:07 PM - Vishak: But question non action of Bjp government in state is correct
13/04/18, 10:07 PM - Lola Infosys: I really feel sad. Rapist shud be hanged . But This time it's just fake  propoganda.
13/04/18, 10:07 PM - Vishak: And let's not start what aboutism

13/04/18, 10:08 PM - Lola Infosys: Modi already gave stmt
13/04/18, 10:08 PM - Vishak: Ok but in general ppl r defending the rapist that's wrong
13/04/18, 10:08 PM - Lola Infosys: Assholes like Rajdeep n bharka writing as if modi only did rape n escaping now
13/04/18, 10:08 PM - Vishak: Let law take it's own course
13/04/18, 10:08 PM - Lola Infosys: No one defended. They were asking CBI to take it
13/04/18, 10:08 PM - Vishak: Haha ya tats wrong I feel

13/04/18, 10:10 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lo panda Rahul Gandhi is dumb and we all know that.

Simply I can't say entire Congress are stupid !

They have intelligent people like Sibal too
13/04/18, 10:10 PM - Lola Infosys: S M Krishna was a fine politician in Congress.

13/04/18, 10:11 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Take action when sha, Modi or any top leaders form BJP says Rape is good.
13/04/18, 10:14 PM - Lola Infosys: Congress says minority minority etc.. I can support that if it's equally followed. till now they haven't declared Hindus as minority in muslim majority states.
13/04/18, 10:14 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Alla guru UP and Bihar li crime rate jasti and they are governed by BJP antaralla!!
Everyone one knows that those states are uneducated people doing goondasim and all.

Which party controlled that ?

Since independence if u ask ticket in train, the passengers will beat u to death.

Congress or BJP

It's no one's

13/04/18, 10:18 PM - Lola Infosys: Me n Teja were discussing. If politicians hv guts, they should start propogating the good done by their party. All parties. Not to simply say what other parties did wrong
13/04/18, 10:19 PM - Vishak: Dud that's wrong
13/04/18, 10:20 PM - Vishak: We must criticize as well
13/04/18, 10:22 PM - Lola Infosys: I feel that's in professional. In IT industry, if I need promotion, should I say what good I have done or simply keep saying what others have done wrong.
13/04/18, 10:22 PM - Lola Infosys: I know we can't compare IT
13/04/18, 10:22 PM - Lola Infosys: But still

13/04/18, 10:29 PM - Lola Infosys: I said , irrespective of party, rape is bad. We shud never put party or religion  behind rape. This was too much fake propoganda.
13/04/18, 10:30 PM - Vishak: Guru even meenakshi lekhi alsi

13/04/18, 10:34 PM - Lola Infosys: Why the fuck are they insulting the gods of hindu religion when they support Mohammad who says kill those who don't follow him n go to heaven where 40virgins are waiting.

14/04/18, 9:24 AM - Vishak: I feel this incident has badly hurt Bjp, they must have understood that women are the highest users of social media and hence hurting women's sentiments might cost them. Its nothing to do with justice and all. The majority which Hindus they wer trying to use as vote bank but now that they understand women is majority in social media they might have to rebook their strategy. Cause women get united if it's against women which ever caste, religion they belong. Things to learn....

16/04/18, 10:50 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: For centuries, they destroyed our temples, they vandalised our Murtis, they raped our women and they sold our children into slavery. And yet, people held on to their Dharma against all odds. These were ordinary people, people with no great means, people of little learning maybe, but with great faith. Yes, I see the same Dharma being practised even today with the same steadfastness.

Yes, what we have together is worth fighting for! As Hindus who are aware of the sinisterness of the attacks on the Dharma, it is our duty to fight.

As Sitaram Goyal once put it, every conscious Hindu mind is a soldier for the Dharma.

Remember, धर्मएवहतोहन्तिधर्मोरक्षतिरक्षितः

Dharma protects those who protect it!

17/04/18, 9:26 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: The World Bank said on Sunday that India’s economy has recovered from the impact of demonetisation and the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax regime, and would grow at 7.3% in 2018 and 7.5% in 2019. The organisation, in its bi-annual South Asia Economic Focus report, said this would drive South Asia’s growth rate to 6.9% in 2018 and 7.1% in 2019.
17/04/18, 9:27 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: World Bank report on South Asia says Indian economy has recovered from impact of demonetisation, GST https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.scroll.in/article/875802/world-bank-says-indian-economy-has-recovered-from-the-impact-of-demonetisation-gst

17/04/18, 9:32 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: World Bank's statement on India's growth is clear slap on those who condemned the implementation of  'Demonetization' and 'GST'
17/04/18, 9:35 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Nodu modi told this implementation will give a long term positive effect.

Now it's has started delivering

The people will not debate about this now
17/04/18, 9:37 AM - Anni jss: That's true. The countries which have implemented GST had a short term negative effect, but have enjoyed long term benefits.
17/04/18, 9:37 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Every news channel who were Congis supporter are also praising the news

That's Modi 👌🏼👌🏼

17/04/18, 11:59 AM - Anni jss: With all alliances moving out of the NDA, will it be possible for the BJP to come back to power in 2019?        Kunal V Manusmare.   I don't know if BJP will come back in power or not! I am not sure! Since Dalits are being convinced that Modi is against them, Jats are being convinced that Modi is against them, Marathas are being convinced that Modi is against them, farmers are being convinced that Modi is against them and Muslims are being convinced that Modi was always against them! Massive propaganda which is often false! Hate spreading through print, electronic and social media! All this will surely have some effect, many out of 1.4 billion of us are not well informed, some informed are idealistic, some informed are selfish! Some informed are 18 year old and haven't really experienced old governments! Some informed are to busy to get into quarrel! Some informed don't want to get labelled as #Bhakt! MODI MAY FALL! But, it will not be Modi who will actually fall!

Final tally will decide the PM candidate! There will be a dirty fight within the coalition for the important portfolios and the chair of PM! There will be hard negotiations and dirty bargains for railway, coal, telecom and infra ministries, not to make it better but to reap benefits out of it! All the good work done by People like Piyush Goel, Nitin Gadkari, Sushma Swaraj, Manohar Parrikar, Nirmala Sitharaman under able leadership of Modi will get directional deflection or break!

There will be still communal tensions once in a while, It is a upbringing of this society for last 70 years, everyone has been painted and labelled differently, bound to happen! Dalits and Muslims will still remain backward and a vote bank (It’s for both the communities to introspect, why they are backward even after 70 years in spite of being a vote bank!), farmers may be gifted with loan waiver to make them bankrupt in another five years! People like Mr. Ravish Kumar will do another episode with black screen to appear intellectual of intellectuals! Critics will keep criticizing governments. There will not be discipline, there will not be targets, there will not be follow up! Ministers of different parties will behave like independent kings and will not be answerable to any authority! Corruption will increase to crazy levels! Meanwhile China is getting stronger everyday, it will snatch the tital of super power from US very soon! Hence massive geopolitical challenges ahead! There might be a war over water in near future! We need to earn more money, strengthen ourselves, that’s the way to avoide the war! Trade wars! Russia’s empty pockets and China’s deep pockets! Who is good enough to handle this situation for good of 1.4 billion people!? The great Rahul Gandhi? Psycho Arvind Kejriwal (Whom, I have worshiped like a god for good three years!)? Fool Kanhaiyya or Prejudice Ravish Kumar?

Dirty coalition will give ugly break to growth momentum Modiji has given to this country. What will Dalit achieve out of this and what Muslims will get!? Will Maratha’s and jat’s get reservation!? Will farmers stop suicides, what is the reason farmers started committing suicide in first place? That day people will say “Iss se tho Modi accha tha” that will not repair the situation!

Modi has been working on long term and concrete solutions for collective good! Everyone will be at benefit in long term, not realizing it and not keeping patience will take us further away from the dream 'Antyoday’!

Modi is a human and can not yield answer to chronic problems created over past 70 years in 4 years! Have practical expectation, understand the constraints and limitations of largest democracy and then pass the judgement on Modi! The job is not as easy as Kunal Kamra to make people laugh by saying “Hamere jawan seema pe lad rahein hain..” I have been following Defence Ministry since last 10 years very closely and this government has done phenomenal work, which normal public is not aware of! And when cheap people like Kunal Kamra makes fun of the work done and send wrong message across, my blood boils..

All this will not lead to fall of Modi but fall of Republic of India! We will loose a leader who is strong, progressive, hard and smart working and doesn't fear to take the right decision by worrying about vote banks! The same vicious cycle will continue which holded us back from being great for so many years, inspite of having all the resources to become greatest of all!

It's duty of every informed Dalit, Maratha, Jat and Muslim to inform people with the truth and explain the situation and consequences, else fall is sure!

I am a Maratha by cast and I keep receiving msgs in family and community Whats App groups that Modi and his party is against our community and uninformed people fall for it! And I feel pity on the people who are doing this propaganda and people falling for it. As Voltaire have said..

“I would rather obey a fine lion, much stronger than myself, than two hundred rats of my own species..”

Modi will be engraved in history as a glorified soldier who did everything he could do for good of his land! Alas! His own people couldn't understand it! As Marcus Cicero have said..

“I have always been of the opinion, that unpopularity, earned by doing what is right, is not unpopularity at all, but glory..”

We live in a quick fix society! Everyone is yelling where is the growth!? Where are the benefits of Demonetization, all the currency is back!? Where are the benefits of Swacch Bharat, my colony is still dirty!? Where are the benefits of Make In India, we still buy Chinese manufactured phone! Where are the 15 lakhs!? Poor souls! I hope they will come across the story of the Chinese Bamboo Tree someday!

I followed UPA1 & UPA2 very closely, read and educated myself a lot about India and it’s problems and what kind of mess India is, I learned about limitations and constraints created over past 70 years and when I saw Modiji handling this mess so well in the backdrop of a prejudice hatred and criticism, my respect for him grown in multi-pal folds! Modiji has done amazing hard and smart work on so many fronts and I am so grateful to him for what he has done and achieved in past 4 years! Of course there are few mistakes, but can anything in this world ever be perfectly flawless!? For example, I never understood the ‘COW’ issue, but do we know what kind of pressure must be there on him from within the party! In a family or any small or big organisation, there will always be some people who we know are wrong and culprit for some mess, but we can’t help but to tolerate them at the cost of the unity of the family or at the cost of some bigger advantage in the case of organisation!

One thing for sure, even critics will praise Modi someday, but it will be of no use then!

Finally, I would like readers to take a look at what Theodore Roosevelt had said.. A must read!

The man in the Arena!

￼

PS. I am not a member of RSS or BJP nor a spirited Hindu but yes I am very grateful to BJP for offering such a great leader to this country! You can surely call me #Bhakt, I wear that crown with immense pride.

Update. Thank you friends for a such a great response to the answer in such a short time, I guess putting the heart out always works!
17/04/18, 12:04 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: BJP will not fall, as it mentioned in the aforementioned most of indians are uninformed about the real things happening across India.

3 or 4 guys may visit your home claiming they are from water company, to install shower caps, to save water! They may also claim they are from bescom to change light bulbs for free! They have been spotted in several areas. Plz do NOT let them into your homes. They are Robbers robbing people at gun-point. Plz alert all your contacts, as you may save a life. Make sure door is locked at all times, Use door chains always.

28/04/18, 9:39 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Modi, walked into a bar around 9:58 pm. He sat down next to Rahul at the bar and stared up at the TV.

The 10 pm news was coming on. The news crew was covering the story of a man on the ledge of a large building preparing to jump.

Rahul looked at Modi and said, "Do you think he will jump ?"

Modi said, "You know, I bet he will jump."

Rahul replied, "Well, I bet he won't."

Modi placed Rs. 1000 on the bar and said, "You're on !"

Just as Rahul placed his money on the bar, the guy on the ledge jumped off the building, falling to his death.

Rahul was very upset, but willingly handed his Rs.1000 to Modi, saying, "Fair is fair. Here's your money."

Modi replied, "I can't take your money. I saw this earlier on the 5 pm news, and so I knew he would jump."

Rahul replied, "I did too, but didn't think he would do it again.

This time Modi took the money.

4) Extra Special Pani Puri - Rs. 18.
5) Double Extra Special Pani Puri - Rs. 20.
6) Sunday Special Pani Puri - Rs. 25 (Sunday only).

To check each and every Pani Puri for its different taste, I started eating everyday a different one. . . . .

But soon I discovered that each and every one had the same taste of Pani Puri.

Finally one day I asked him the reason for the same taste?
💷 💵 💴

Pani Puriwala said: Pani Puri cost. . . . Rs 10

Special Pani Puri means spoons washed ... 🍴

Very Special Pani Puri means spoon and plates both washed ... 🍛🍴

Extra Special Pani Puri means washing hands before putting the Pani Puri in washed plates & served with washed spoons... 👏

Double Extra Special Pani Puri means clean drinking water is provided separately ... 💧

Pani Puri wala now looking at my face ....

Then I asked What is Sunday Special?

Pani Puri wala said :

"Sunday ... I take bath...!!" 😀😁😂😃😄😅😆😜😝🤣🤣🤣🤣

04/05/18, 8:00 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Support BSP then
04/05/18, 8:01 AM - Nagendra: Education is key.. nothing else.. no educated person treated u like animal.. u being educated should think of that.. than fighting blindly for something which happened in past.... Current day scenario needs talented people to come up.. nothing else should matter.. talent capabilities should matter..
04/05/18, 8:02 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Leave it it's waste
04/05/18, 8:03 AM - Theja: Congress only till election use us I know.
But now RSS bjp agenda is clear.
Its always debatable
04/05/18, 8:03 AM - Nagendra: <Media omitted>
04/05/18, 8:03 AM - Theja: Then marry sc doctor
04/05/18, 8:04 AM - Nagendra: Shata don't come into personal matter.. u r talking about being treated like animal.. u want to bring reservation in marriage also 🤣
04/05/18, 8:05 AM - Nagendra: First every brahmin should see 10 SC girls .. if doesn't work then see Brahmin girl 🤣

04/05/18, 8:06 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Many cases intercaste marriages happened, what r u relating here ?
04/05/18, 8:06 AM - Theja: Ppl follow caste I mean
04/05/18, 8:06 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: What their agenda tell me
04/05/18, 8:07 AM - Theja: Actually except ambedkar none of our guys have worked for us. Actually Indra Gandhi gundu roa was Brahmin they have worked for us .
04/05/18, 8:07 AM - Nagendra: People following caste not following caste it's personal option.. as long as other caste not being hurt y the fuck u care.. r u feeling insecure ...
04/05/18, 8:08 AM - Nagendra: Samartha is sanketi company.. they offered u job right..
04/05/18, 8:09 AM - Nagendra: If u r supporting reservation thinking it will remove castism u r fool..
04/05/18, 8:10 AM - Nagendra: It will only bring in more hatred..
04/05/18, 8:11 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Then why you support BSP
04/05/18, 8:11 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: *You don't you
04/05/18, 8:11 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: If your agenda is clear, support BSP. Is is for dalit empowerment right ?
04/05/18, 8:11 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Why BJP or Congress
04/05/18, 8:11 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: ?
04/05/18, 8:14 AM - Nagendra: There is no fucking school or college which rejects admission for a talented dalit student.. economically weak ok I understand give them free education.. but that should be applicable for all economically weak people irrespective of caste..
04/05/18, 8:14 AM - Vishak: Indian bank madurai
04/05/18, 8:15 AM - Vishak: <Media omitted>
04/05/18, 8:16 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Even my director talks like teja, that there is no place for backward in industry anta. But when I question Rajanna and sudeep caste he will become silent
04/05/18, 8:17 AM - Nagendra: Yeah.. simply they r talking keeping something in mind.. reality is different.. they r not ready to accept it
04/05/18, 8:17 AM - Vishak: Thu wtf morning morning
04/05/18, 8:17 AM - Vishak: Nagi also involving innpoliy🤦🏻‍♂
04/05/18, 8:18 AM - Vishak: Politics
04/05/18, 8:18 AM - Nagendra: Theja supporting Prakash Raj.. 
Reservation talks.. these two triggered me..
04/05/18, 8:20 AM - Nagendra: Were u treated like slave panda.. 
Were u treated like animal panda..
Were u economically backward panda.. 

I know answer is no for all.. give me one reason for u to have reservations man..
04/05/18, 8:25 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: No Answer available
04/05/18, 8:26 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: If all poor get facilities they can improve irrespective of caste
04/05/18, 8:28 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: But those JNU fools are with prakash, what the fuck is wrong ?

Just because their university name is Nehru, they are getting food from his family, it's the government money
04/05/18, 8:28 AM - Nagendra: Exactly.. make reservations laws what ever u want generally for the poor.. not based on caste..
04/05/18, 8:28 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Congress always keep their leaders names in all plans, like Indira canteen, nehru university, Nehru urban development, rajiv gabdhi health insurance, it's like all giving their own money
04/05/18, 8:29 AM - Theja: I still did not get answer
It's not personal we live in a country all should be equal
If you follow caste I need reservation
04/05/18, 8:29 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Why reservation is required is my question?
04/05/18, 8:30 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Since 70 years the dalit are improved in both socially and personally.

I think it is the mindset of few who thinks we are still behind.
04/05/18, 8:31 AM - Nagendra: Baseless talks.. u like a hero I like a hero.. u like whisky I like rum that's it.. u cant make rule everyone should drink 60 whisky then only drink rum..
04/05/18, 8:31 AM - Nagendra: Exactly.  It's mindset which is wrong ..
04/05/18, 8:31 AM - Vishak: Y u asking me 😕
04/05/18, 8:32 AM - Nagendra: R u supporting reservation based on caste or not..
04/05/18, 8:32 AM - Vishak: No
04/05/18, 8:32 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Teja, this is the question. This is the solution for your agenda. But I know including you no other dalit support this party.

Cause where there is money there lies people, agenda and all gimmick
04/05/18, 8:32 AM - Nagendra: Good boy.. I support u then
04/05/18, 8:33 AM - Theja: Because people don't stop at Hindu level. 
We still have caste sub caste
04/05/18, 8:33 AM - Nagendra: Even in Christianity Muslims all have subcaste.. why don't they have reservations..
04/05/18, 8:34 AM - Theja: I like rum I like reservation
04/05/18, 8:34 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Seriously supporting that ಪ್ರಕಾಚ ? you can do better teja with your agenda.
04/05/18, 8:34 AM - Lola Infosys: Keep reservation on ecenomicaly backward, not socially backward. Simple. Everything will be treated equally across castes, religion, sub castes, community, etc etc
04/05/18, 8:34 AM - Nagendra: Exactly.. tell that theja.. m bored of his baseless talks..
04/05/18, 8:35 AM - hrushikesh ms: This is correct
04/05/18, 8:36 AM - hrushikesh ms: First sensible thing from lola 🤓
04/05/18, 8:36 AM - Vishak: 🤣
04/05/18, 8:36 AM - Lola Infosys: It will take time, ppl will take advantage here also. Blame games happen. But it's far far better than earlier reservation
04/05/18, 8:36 AM - Lola Infosys: Dei
04/05/18, 8:37 AM - Lola Infosys: I rest my case your honour
04/05/18, 8:37 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Problem with dalit, even you have untouchability within your caste
04/05/18, 8:37 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: SC kandre ST agalla, ST avaranna SC madve agalla. ST people SC avaranna muttalla.
04/05/18, 8:37 AM - hrushikesh ms: But why BJP wants single country single religion .  We elected for government not some hidden hidutva things ..
04/05/18, 8:38 AM - Vishak: Correct kesha
04/05/18, 8:38 AM - Lola Infosys: Is BJP comprised of only Hindus?
04/05/18, 8:38 AM - Vishak: Also I m not happy with the way they are handling our economics
04/05/18, 8:38 AM - Lola Infosys: #JustAsking
04/05/18, 8:38 AM - Lola Infosys: 😂
04/05/18, 8:39 AM - Lola Infosys: Now teja will support me irrespective of what I say.  Coz this is Prakash rai symbol
04/05/18, 8:39 AM - Theja: Socially we are still divided. Most of us are following caste.
We will still be developing
04/05/18, 8:39 AM - Vishak: Bere yella gimics only but the way they are handling the economics too much interference with judiciary u m really worried
04/05/18, 8:40 AM - Lola Infosys: Only for adults

04/05/18, 8:40 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Only you are not happy, you Vs the World bank. You are too intelligent
04/05/18, 8:40 AM - Vishak: 😒
04/05/18, 8:41 AM - Vishak: Ok m stopping I just point🙏
04/05/18, 8:43 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Kesha, one of the agenda of BJP is hindutva. I don't think there is anything wrong.

When India has AMU JNU who are threats to our religion, and other religion people teasing our gods and our festival. We need some support to protect our religion.

That is what BJP doing. Just because Vajapayee is Brahmin and BJP made him PM, then entire party will not become pro brahmin
04/05/18, 8:44 AM - Theja: Anti secular anti Constitution
04/05/18, 8:44 AM - Nagendra: 1. Supporting caste based reservation .. Mistake..
2. Supporting Congress because they support caste based reservation.. bigger mistake..
3. Supporting Prakash Raj because he supports Congress .. SIN

I rest my case..
04/05/18, 8:45 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: India and Nepal are the only Hindu nations, what is wrong with angenda
04/05/18, 8:45 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lol you ignored my reply above to kesha

04/05/18, 8:53 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: <Media omitted>
04/05/18, 8:59 AM - hrushikesh ms: AMU JNU are fringe groups, and what they do is wrong, but being a national party in power why to follow that negative path. See all Muslims can go to Pakistan , all Hindus can go to Nepal , let Indians leave in India ..
04/05/18, 9:00 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: There is no negative path, it is just precautions. After the lose Congress will perform more riot on the basis of religion.

We must have some strong defense.
04/05/18, 9:01 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: <Media omitted>
04/05/18, 9:04 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Shitty people criticizing Puneeth for meeting Modi, what a bunch of assholes

04/05/18, 9:31 AM - Theja: I think it's karma which is hitting back 
It all started because there was inequality, socially I still see inequality. 
However even for us karma Will hit back if we simply get seat with reservation without skill we deceive a skilled guy. After 100 yrs we face karma. 
The cycle repeats.
04/05/18, 9:31 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: 😅
04/05/18, 9:33 AM - Lola Infosys: Karma already swalpa bantalla. 20k promotions made void. Education, job ge reservation beku. Kelsa madalla. Aadru promotion beku. Durase

04/05/18, 9:37 AM - Lola Infosys: Like how naga got nepal number long back. That recharge guy's book was misused😜

04/05/18, 10:01 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: And this happen in villages also, alle jasti
04/05/18, 10:02 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Complaining on upper caste has no sense at all.
04/05/18, 10:02 AM - Vishak: In theory yes not practical. The problem is technology used for biometrics only is in question. Again all r questioning implementation not the idea itself. But anyway linking everything to aadhar I m against it. Also creating one I'd also I m against it.
04/05/18, 10:02 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: That's why I'm telling repeatedly, support BSP
04/05/18, 10:02 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Tika mucchu, bari topic divert , avail answer kodade illa neenu

04/05/18, 10:04 AM - Theja: @919916841884 @919972584992 pls watch it has msg it's shooted in 2012
04/05/18, 10:05 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: When it comes to marriage between those 2 case, so much rivalry.

Everything is recorded in books I read in history, not by one author, it includes many, kambar is dalit writer he also mentioned so much in his novels
04/05/18, 10:05 AM - Vishak: The guy who has designed idea he is from infy
04/05/18, 10:06 AM - Vishak: He is good only
04/05/18, 10:06 AM - Vishak: But still imolementing is not practical in India
04/05/18, 10:06 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: You are great. Shall I ask you one question which party implemented Aadhar??

04/05/18, 10:08 AM - Vishak: Wtf r u talking? I m not understanding😒
04/05/18, 10:08 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lot of congis supporters talk like shit, 1st thing they speak is nothing will happen in India so don't change or implement
04/05/18, 10:08 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: What the fuck

04/05/18, 10:11 AM - Vishak: Not enough technology
04/05/18, 10:11 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: How Modi achieved and Congress couldn't.

Congress stopped because they are afraid to manage huge population. But Modi pushed the limit.

What went wrong now ? Is any one killed or any property lost ?
04/05/18, 10:11 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Only a fool like you can think there is no security in India
04/05/18, 10:11 AM - Vishak: What he achieve?

04/05/18, 10:15 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Only the number is enough
04/05/18, 10:15 AM - Vishak: Dude still now with one finger print u get 10 sims

Creating bank accounts to many ppl.

04/05/18, 2:25 PM - Ba: For 70 years, no media was there to tell everything what Congress did or ppl were uneducated to know. Congress has never attempted to lift the common man's life . They have maintained I'm nice way, printing text books about Gandhi, Indira ,Nehru as gods.

However they didn't do anything for poor Brahmin I agree. Any part who try to remove reservation will loose . We are vote bank.

04/05/18, 2:56 PM - Lola Infosys: Correct
04/05/18, 2:57 PM - Theja: Yeah even I support all treated as human

If I am born as a Brahmin
Society is with you.
You have options to become priest teacher hotel top jobs.

If I'm born dalit. Take overall india people refuse to drink tea in your cup. If you open hotel will they come . So that option gone . You cannot become priest. If there is no reservation I don't know if they even allow inside school or college. (Its has happened in history).

Actually manu smriti all bull shit.

Caste itself is bull shit I don't know who invented
04/05/18, 3:07 PM - Lola Infosys: best joke ever

04/05/18, 3:42 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Congress still misusing it
04/05/18, 3:43 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Again that doesn't answer why reservation required.

If untouchability happening, raise issue make documentary, appeal in court, international court, alert India.

Instead getting reservation will not solve anything

They not allowed dalits to cross line.

Why won't all dalit vote for BSP
04/05/18, 4:34 PM - Theja: No I'm best example
First 10yrs nothing changed
If cong did not continue reservation I would still be slave. 
Bjp is pro ved manu smriti where they have defined jobs for dalit 
Carring shit slavery etc

04/05/18, 4:46 PM - Theja: Personal experience
Before coming to Mysore
We used to get transfer
When we used search house and say we are sc they never gave us home for rent.
We have to lie to get. May be it's small but even in Karnataka it's there. You don't have first hand experience

04/05/18, 4:48 PM - Theja: After ambedkar it's mostly Brahmin leaders who have helped us. All others only for vote. Actually we have good image on bramhmins
04/05/18, 4:50 PM - Anni jss: Then why don't raise voice when brahmins are criticized?
04/05/18, 4:51 PM - Anni jss: Few months back, there was a video where few people belonging to SC St and obc made bad statements and remarks against pejavara swamiji and other brahmins, nobody came in support of brahmins.

04/05/18, 5:49 PM - Lola Infosys: Long back casteism was there I agree. Congress in their 70yr rule , atleast 50% , ie,  30yrs have given caste based reservation. I think now it is not required. Coz in those 30yrs it would have become stable and equal.
04/05/18, 5:50 PM - Anni jss: Cos brahmins don't raise their voice.
04/05/18, 5:51 PM - Lola Infosys: Last week one issue came in news. Some police selection, they wrote caste on their chest. If ppl can write it on paper and applications, why not on chest.  What's the difference. They would hv put it for some time saving. For that also Congress blamed bjp
04/05/18, 5:59 PM - Theja: Socially there is inequality I have first hand experience that's what I told.
Casteism has >500 yrs history. It takes same time to go

04/05/18, 7:07 PM - Lola Infosys: I have 2 personal experiences.. 
One guy crashed into my mama's car parked in front of his house. On footpath. He created ruckus, police also came by then . Police talked to both parties. Came n told, sir he is SC you are brahmin, cant get anything from him. He can always say he is poor and court case will drag. That guy had 2 gold rings on each hand and driving SUV.
04/05/18, 7:08 PM - Lola Infosys: Another my uncle has a small building 8 rooms given for rent. All 4 were SC, 2 were muslim. these 6 were not giving rent from more than a year. When uncle argued for months together, he got a notice from a layer saying you are trying to push SC and minorities out of building by force. This is court notice. He had to sell the building later.
04/05/18, 7:09 PM - Lola Infosys: These happen from all sides. Root cause is all policies made based on caste and community. So better to remove it . .
04/05/18, 7:10 PM - Vishak: Nagi Wer r u?
04/05/18, 7:10 PM - Vishak: Call me
04/05/18, 7:11 PM - Anni jss: Similar experience happened in a bank where my uncle was working. Some meeting was going on in office. Manager asked peon to get coffee. Peon was sc or st I don't remember. Coffee was bad. Manager told coffee is not nice, get another coffee. That.peon poured coffee on him and when to.police saying manager did it
04/05/18, 7:11 PM - Lola Infosys: He had to sell it for 20lks coz there were ppl still living inside and no one was willing to buy with such tenants. Actual value was 60+ lks. This is 7yrs back.
04/05/18, 7:12 PM - Anni jss: The thing which went for discussion in SC was for such stuff itself. Not to dilute facilities for SC or st, but to amend a rule which does not enquire who was at fault but just punish upper caste.
04/05/18, 7:12 PM - Vishak: Lo sumnirappa the will go out of the group 🤣
04/05/18, 7:12 PM - Anni jss: For that such big bandh was done. People did not understand what the issue was
04/05/18, 7:12 PM - Vishak: Theja
04/05/18, 7:13 PM - Lola Infosys: I'm not against SC at all. I'm against such stupid rules which is one sided
04/05/18, 7:13 PM - Anni jss: Nija heludre uriyutte Alva 😁
04/05/18, 7:14 PM - Anni jss: Exactly. I agree. I am also not against any community caste.. only against such stupid rules
04/05/18, 7:14 PM - Lola Infosys: So remove caste based rules n policies. It will be solved
04/05/18, 7:15 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Mayawathi is more powerful and fierce than pedda pappu, but no one wants to vote and make her big.
04/05/18, 7:17 PM - Lola Infosys: Her elephant park is the most stupidest idea ever . Spending ppl tax for such a waste thing
04/05/18, 7:17 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Oh I remember her own statues as well
04/05/18, 7:17 PM - Anni jss: Now u know theja why ppl refuse to rent house for minorities, backward communities. They are politically backed. Whatever they do, ppl cannot question it. I am not saying everyone is bad. But people have that fear that it might create problems
04/05/18, 7:19 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Only thing I know or heard from is was when vajapayee took oath as PM. Few made issues as he was brahmin.

I don't see what is wrong there ?
04/05/18, 7:20 PM - Anni jss: The same guys are not praising bjp or modi when they made kovind a dalit as president
04/05/18, 7:22 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Yeah 😂
04/05/18, 7:29 PM - Anni jss: If Congress makes a dalit or a Muslim or a women president then that is empowerment. If bjp does it then it's vote polarization
04/05/18, 7:39 PM - Theja: Agree in both cases there are negative
04/05/18, 7:39 PM - Theja: I feel casteism is main reason why country is not growing

Unfortunately I can't put bullshit all the time on timeline even if it's true and try to bully. I m not born bully. We need more and more ppl like theja who can face the bully and express the opinions cause it's his right. By doing this it might neutralize bombarding of trolls on our news feed. Most rational ppl who support either parties or none would avoid commenting since they don't want bullshit in this or u may say information overload.

*ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಪಕ್ಷದ 1947ರ ನಂತರದ ಹಗರಣಗಳ ಪಟ್ಟಿ*
http://samanyakannadiga.blogspot.in/2017/09/blog-post.html?m=1
*ಸಮಸ್ತ ದೇಶಬಾಂಧವರಲ್ಲಿ ನನ್ನದೊಂದು ಮನವಿ. ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಭ್ರಷ್ಟಾಚಾರದ ಕರಾಳ ಮುಖವನ್ನು ಸಂಪೂರ್ಣವಾಗಿ ತಿಳಿದುಕೊಳ್ಳಿ. ನಮ್ಮ ದೇಶ ಬಡ ದೇಶವೇ??? ಅಲ್ಲವೇ ಅಲ್ಲ!!! ಕೇವಲ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಇದರ ಮೂಲ. 
ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಹಗರಣಗಳ ಕರಾಳ ಮುಖದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಒಂದಿಷ್ಟು :  
ಇದು ಶುರು ಆಗಿದ್ದು ನೆಹರು ಕಾಲದಲ್ಲಿ, ‘If I take a small portion of the national property to my house, there is no loss for the nation’ ಎಂಬ  justification ನೊಂದಿಗೆ. ಇನ್ನೂ ನಡೆಯುತ್ತಲೇ ಇದೆ.....

ಈ ದುಡ್ಡನ್ನು ಕೂಡಿದರೆ ನಮಗೆ ಸಿಗುವ ಮೊತ್ತ : *8,031,005,000,000*
ಈ ಹಗರಣಗಳಿಂದ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಪಕ್ಷ ಬೆಳೆಯಿತೇ ಹೊರೆತು ದೇಶದ ಜನ ಏಳಿಗೆ ಕಾಣಲೇ ಇಲ್ಲ. ಬಡವರು ಇನ್ನೂ ಬಡವರಾಗೇ ಇದ್ದಾರೆ. ಇದಕ್ಕೆ ಮೂಲ ಕಾರಣ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಪಕ್ಷ. ಇನ್ನಾದರೂ ದೇಶದ ಜನ ಕಣ್ಣು ತೆರೆದು ಮತ ಹಾಕಲೇ ಬೇಕಿದೆ.....
ಇಷ್ಟು ಮೊತ್ತದ ಹಣ ನಮ್ಮಲಿ ಈಗ ಇದ್ದಿದ್ದರೆ 20 ವರುಷ ತೆರಿಗೆ ಕಟ್ಟಬೇಕಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ, 1500 ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯ ಕಟ್ಟಬಹುದಿತ್ತು.
2000 ಆಸ್ಪತ್ರೆಗಳ ಕಟ್ಟಬಹುದಿತ್ತು. ಉಚಿತವಾಗಿ ಮೆಡಿಸಿನ್ ವಿತರಿಸಬಹುದಿತ್ತು. 95 ಕೋಟಿ ಜನರಿಗೆ ಸ್ವಂತ ಮನೆ 
ಇರುತ್ತಿತ್ತು..
ಇನ್ನಾದರೂ ನನಗೆ ಸಂಬಂಧವಿಲ್ಲ, ಅನ್ನೋ ಹಾಗೆ ಬದುಕಬೇಡಿ. ದೇಶದ ಏಳಿಗೆ ಮುಖ್ಯ. 
ಈಗ ಹೇಳಿ ನಮ್ಮ ದೇಶ ಬಡ ದೇಶವೇ...???????

13/05/18, 9:47 AM - Anni jss: When u are given a chance to choose someone, use that opportunity to choose. Else don't shout, don't blame
13/05/18, 9:48 AM - Vishak: I know in davengere one constistuancy nobody voted
13/05/18, 9:49 AM - Vishak: Coz no party has done anything there
13/05/18, 9:49 AM - Nagendra: <Media omitted>
13/05/18, 9:50 AM - Vishak: Hmm I dono it works in India
13/05/18, 9:51 AM - Vishak: But in someway it will ease the process
13/05/18, 9:52 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: It should be mandatory, educated people must volunteer they don't need some law
13/05/18, 9:52 AM - Vishak: Ya u tweeted about Bangalore I saw they should have voted
13/05/18, 9:53 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: If I was in power I would have stopped Kaveri water for them
13/05/18, 9:54 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Power cut madtidde atleast 2 hours daily and gave the same power to remote villages where they voted responsibly
13/05/18, 9:54 AM - Vishak: So many problems in Bangalore
13/05/18, 9:54 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Because of these assholes
13/05/18, 9:54 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Educated ante sha
13/05/18, 9:54 AM - Vishak: Ya waste
13/05/18, 9:54 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: People came from foreign and voted
13/05/18, 9:55 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: These asshokes went on trip or stayed in home, whatever they lost freedom of speech
13/05/18, 9:56 AM - Vishak: Ya like nagi said they must see who is from that constituency and vote. If same guy is ter must change
13/05/18, 9:57 AM - Vishak: Wasted now
13/05/18, 9:57 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lo what is the problem in voting NOTA ? at least they should turn up for voting right
13/05/18, 9:58 AM - Vishak: Nota swalpa problem ide. But if all r voting it can be introduced
13/05/18, 9:58 AM - Anni jss: Like all fingers are not the same, all candidates are not the same. Some might be more corrupt, some might be less. Let them vote who ever is better. If they don't vote, possibility of the worst winning becomes more
13/05/18, 9:58 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Pedda
13/05/18, 9:58 AM - Anni jss: What problem?
13/05/18, 9:58 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Vishak is the problem
13/05/18, 10:00 AM - Vishak: See thing is for example u think no party is good u vote Nota the end result is u the most corrupt guy result is still not effected
13/05/18, 10:00 AM - Vishak: Ya right it's ok
13/05/18, 10:00 AM - Vishak: As a right it's ok
13/05/18, 10:00 AM - Anni jss: U are right. Voting for NOTA only helps the worst candidate
13/05/18, 10:01 AM - Anni jss: But Gujarat mandate was a good one. Huge votes went to NOTA. NOTA should make the candidates/parties introspect as to what's wrong. Why people didn't vote us and voted NOTA
13/05/18, 10:03 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: <Media omitted>
13/05/18, 10:15 AM - Vishak: Ya Nota must play critical if for example for that constituency if Nota vote % is more than 40% provided voting is mandatory. Then remust relelection for that constituency with new party members.
13/05/18, 10:22 AM - Anni jss: That rule is already there.
13/05/18, 10:25 AM - Nikil Play: Ur vote has been used by Congress😝

13/05/18, 1:05 PM - Anni jss: Yes she didn't vote. Read in newspaper
13/05/18, 7:54 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: The voting has been done and dusted. There has been excellent voting in the regions of Old Mysore, Udupi, Uttara Kannada etc. just like the SSLC and PUC results. The range of 70-75 % voting, with the highest being a couple of seats with 85% voting.

And just like always: Congrats to the folks from Bangalore ( the so-called educated, the silicon valley of India)having the least turnout as always ! with a maximum of 60% voting only!!

Who are these people from Bangalore:
1. The people who can't bifurcate between wet and dry waste.
2. The most vocal and cribbing people on Social Media.
3. The people who love to party hard let it be weekdays / weekends.
4. People who constantly crib about Metro not being completed on time.
5. And finally, the people who *NEVER VOTE*

Congrats to the rest of Karnataka for making their nation proud and showing Bangalore that - they are just fit for cribbing!
13/05/18, 7:55 PM - Anni jss: Bangalore only 49%
13/05/18, 8:07 PM - Vishak: 👍🏻

Hindutva can mean bringing about equality. Not to make Hindus a upper hand.

No, I don't agree. FuckYogi, fuckModi, RSS, hinduvta. Resign
17/05/18, 8:22 AM - Lola Infosys: @919538015315 , pls answer these two. Hindutva is to make Hindus get equal respect and rules n policies. Not to make them supreme leaders.
17/05/18, 8:22 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: He can't answer, I gave a question when he reply
17/05/18, 8:25 AM - Lola Infosys: Nagi gave perfect answer to Teja, let there be any religion, if govt policies and politicians don't give a fuck abt religion n caste and make rules equally treating all as humans, then there won't be any clashes. Even politicians can't make dirty politics based on religion. Even if they do, ppl won't vote them.

17/05/18, 1:57 PM - Lola Infosys: They should utilise these many amounts from 70yrs and made some proper help. One example is river joining

17/05/18, 3:01 PM - Vishak: There are many instances where Bjp was wrong I rarely saw bhakts questioning. But mostly wat bhakts due is flood their timeline with BJP news all positive whether it's true or fake. I see others mostly giving opinions not giving clean chit to wat they say

21/05/18, 10:57 AM - Vishak: Guys lot of discussion on petrol and fuel rate I m seeing
21/05/18, 10:58 AM - Vishak: I was thinking of a solution I m not sure I m right
21/05/18, 10:58 AM - Vishak: What if we have petrol card sponsored by government
21/05/18, 10:59 AM - Vishak: Petrol card will be of different types with different annual fees
21/05/18, 10:59 AM - Lola Infosys: Oil ministry and biz will lose money from electric cars. So they will definitely try to make money now before they lose biz.. so expect lot of hikes in next 10 yrs
21/05/18, 11:00 AM - Vishak: Ya
21/05/18, 11:00 AM - Lola Infosys: Golmaal
21/05/18, 11:00 AM - Vishak: I don't think any government will reduce petrol price
21/05/18, 11:01 AM - Lola Infosys: Ya. Oil biz is one of the biggest mafia in the world. They only rule govts
21/05/18, 11:02 AM - Lola Infosys: Explain more
21/05/18, 11:07 AM - hrushikesh ms: <Media omitted>
21/05/18, 11:23 AM - Vishak: Ok for eg u pay Rs 250 for silver card annually. U will get petrol for Rs 50/ litre for first 4 litres. It's valid for a day. U can use it once every day. If it exceeds 4 litre. They have to pay normal charge. Again this will be optional for citizens. For some other card the price will be high for annual fees but litres limit will extend. I m not sure of calculation of price and litre but more the idea.
21/05/18, 11:24 AM - Vishak: Actual price of petrol is 33
21/05/18, 11:24 AM - Vishak: So even if u add gst 28% it will be 45
21/05/18, 11:25 AM - Vishak: So 5 rupees extra u r adding
21/05/18, 11:26 AM - Vishak: 80 rupees it is ter now because it's one way to collect money to stabilize economy
21/05/18, 11:27 AM - Vishak: I think it was 50 rupees before 2010
21/05/18, 11:29 AM - Vishak: So by doing petrol cards it's useful for public also government I was thinking u need to see both the customer and the company that's how business works
21/05/18, 11:30 AM - Vishak: Also I m considering that prime user of fuel is middle class and above as poor ppl use public transport

21/05/18, 10:31 PM - Lola Infosys: An excellent retort to a question so called liberals and seculars commonly ask:

Q: Who gave BJP/RSS the right to represent Hindus in India......
 
Answered by Neil Mezi on quora:
 
...

Not that I am any RSS fan,

But who gave you the right to steal and claim all of India’s freedom struggle as gift/charity to Indian masses by the sole family/nepotistic dynasty - The Gandhis? Aren't you erasing, white washing, mocking the sacrifices of millions of freedom fighters, mass heroes like Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekar Azad, Subash Chandra Bose etc that laid down their lives for the country?

Who gave you right to loot India for 60 years? Who gave you right to name all airports, ports after your nepotistic family? Is India your personal property?

Who gave you right to donate India’s land coco Islands etc to other nations without seeking Indian masses permission? Is India’s land your personal property?

Who gave you right to declare muslims as minority when Parsis, Jains, Jews, Buddhists, homosexuals, transgenders are actual minority and muslims the second largest majority?

*Who gave you right to tax hindu temples and shrines and use the money for government and expenditure for all religion masses, but exempt tax on muslim and Christian shrines in name of appeasement? Are you punishing hindu faith believers for being hindus?*

Who gave you right to segregate common laws meant for all? You reformed Hindu law and don't touch other religion’s law?

Who gave you right to allow muslims to practice polygamy etc but ban other faiths to do it, isn’t this sheer hypocrisy/ open bias towards one religion followers under the pretence of being secular party?

*Who gave you right to spend Indian tax payers money on madrassa religious education when you don't pay same amount of funds to other religion followers education?*

*Who gave you right to fund haj subsidies, provide minority quota etc to them when you don't provide same subsidies to other faiths to visit their shrine or provide minority quota to kashmiri pandits in JK or other 8 states where hindus are in a minority?*

Who gave you right to send/ use Indian navy frigate to lay wreath on sea burial of Edwina Mountbatten by her love interest Nehru in his personal capacity at British’s South Coast? Is Indian Navy machinery, your family members personal property?

Who gave you right to provide secret/safe passage to criminal Warren Anderson, Union Carbide CEO who was charged with manslaughter by Indian court and put in custody?

Who gave you right to flee a person from custody who was responsible for blinding and deaths of lakhs of people in Bhopal gas tradegy? Whose generation after generation still suffer deformity and yet received no compensation from them. Wasn't that betrayal and criminal on your part to India?

Who gave you right to mock 26/11 tragedy, strikes at border etc from the likes of Digvijay Singh, Sanjay Nirupam etc?

When Dynasty family can answer all these questions, they can bother questioning others.

It's not Caste or BJP not Hindutva fault.

22/05/18, 9:58 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: ‘ಬಾವಲಿ ಜ್ವರ’ಕ್ಕೆ ಕೇರಳದಲ್ಲಿ 10 ಸಾವು – ರೋಗ ಲಕ್ಷಣ ಏನು, ತಡೆಗಟ್ಟೋದು ಹೇಗೆ? ಪೇರಾಂಬ್ರ: ಬಾವಲಿಗಳ ಮೂಲಕ ಹರಡುವ ನಿಪಾ ವೈರಸ್ ಜ್ವರಕ್ಕೆ ಕೇರಳದಲ್ಲಿ ಇದುವರೆಗೆ 10 ಮಂದಿ ಸಾವನ್ನಪ್ಪಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಪುಣೆಯಲ್ಲಿರುವ ನ್ಯಾಷನಲ್ ಇನ್‍ಸ್ಟಿಟ್ಯೂಟ್ ಆಫ್ ವೈರಾಲಜಿ ಮೂವರ ಸಾವಿಗೆ ನಿಪಾ ವೈರಸ್ ಕಾರಣ ಎನ್ನುವುದನ್ನು ದೃಢಪಡಿಸಿದೆ. ಕೇರಳದ ಕೋಝಿಕ್ಕೋಡ್ ಹಾಗೂ ಮಲಪ್ಪುರಂ ಜಿಲ್ಲೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಈ ರೋಗ ವ್ಯಾಪಕವಾಗಿ ಹರಡಿದೆ ಎನ್ನಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಸಾವಿನ ಸಂಖ್ಯೆ ಏರಿಕೆಯಾಗುತ್ತಿರುವ ಹಿನ್ನೆಲೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಜಿಲ್ಲೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಕಟ್ಟೆಚ್ಚರ ವಹಿಸುವಂತೆ ಸೂಚಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಜೊತೆಗೆ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ವಿವರಗಳನ್ನು ಆರೋಗ್ಯ ಇಲಾಖೆಗೆ ಪ್ರತಿ ನಿತ್ಯ ಆರೋಗ್ಯ ಇಲಾಖೆಗೆ ನೀಡುವಂತೆ ಸೂಚನೆ ನೀಡಲಾಗಿದೆ. ಕೇಂದ್ರ ಆರೋಗ್ಯ ಸಚಿವ ಜೆ.ಪಿ.ನಡ್ಡಾ ಸೂಚನೆಯಂತೆ ಇಂದು ಬೆಳಗ್ಗೆಯೇ ಕೇಂದ್ರ ಸರ್ಕಾರದ ವೈದ್ಯಕೀಯ ತಂಡವೊಂದು ಕೇರಳಕ್ಕೆ ಆಗಮಿಸಿದೆ. ನಿಪಾ ವೈರಸ್ ಎಂದರೇನು?
1998ರಲ್ಲಿ ಮಲೇಷ್ಯಾದ ಕಾಂಪುಂಗ್ ಸುಂಗಾತ್ ನಿಪ್ಪಾ ವಲಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಕಾಣಿಸಿಕೊಂಡ ಮಾರಕ ಜ್ವರಕ್ಕೆ ಕಾರಣವಾದ ವೈರಸನ್ನು ನಿಪಾ ವೈರಸ್ ಎಂದು ಕರೆಯುತ್ತಾರೆ. ನಿಪಾ ವೈರಸ್ ಬಾವಲಿಗಳ ಮೂಲಕ ಹರಡುತ್ತದೆ. ಈ ಕ್ಷಣದವರೆಗೆ ಈ ರೋಗಕ್ಕೆ ಔಷಧಿ ಕಂಡುಹಿಡಿದಿಲ್ಲ. ಹೀಗಾಗಿ ನಿಪಾ ವೈರಸ್ ಮಾರಣಾಂತಿಕ ಎಂದೇ ಕುಖ್ಯಾತಿ ಪಡೆದಿದೆ. ಈ ವೈರಸ್ ಪತ್ತೆಯಾದರೆ ಶೇ.74ರಷ್ಟು ಸಾವು ಖಚಿತ ಎನ್ನಲಾಗಿದೆ. ವೈರಸ್ ಹೇಗೆ ಹರಡುತ್ತದೆ?
ಬಾವಲಿಗಳಿಂದ ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳಿಗೆ ಹರಡುತ್ತದೆ
ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳಿಂದ ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳಿಗೆ ಹರಡುತ್ತದೆ
ಬಾವಲಿಗಳಿಂದ ಮನುಷ್ಯರಿಗೆ ಹರಡುತ್ತದೆ. (ಬಾವಲಿಗಳು ಕಚ್ಚಿದ ಹಣ್ಣನ್ನು ತಿನ್ನುವುದರಿಂದ ಹರಡುತ್ತದೆ)
ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳಿಂದ ಮನುಷ್ಯರಿಗೆ ಹರಡುತ್ತದೆ
ಮನುಷ್ಯರಿಂದ ಮನುಷ್ಯರಿಗೆ ಹರಡುತ್ತದೆ. ನಿಪಾ ವೈರಸ್ ಲಕ್ಷಣಗಳೇನು?
– ಜ್ವರ, ತಲೆ ನೋವು, ವಾಂತಿ, ತಲೆ ಸುತ್ತುವಿಕೆ
– ಕೆಲವರಲ್ಲಿ ಅಪಸ್ಮಾರದ ಲಕ್ಷಣಗಳು ಕಾಣಿಸುತ್ತವೆ
– ಈ ಲಕ್ಷಣಗಳು ಸಾಮಾನ್ಯವಾಗಿ 10ರಿಂದ 12 ದಿನ ಕಾಣಿಸುತ್ತದೆ
– ಬಳಿಕ ಪ್ರಜ್ಞಾಹೀನರಾಗುತ್ತಾರೆ
– ನಂತರ ಈ ಜ್ವರ ತೀವ್ರವಾಗಿ ಮೆದುಳಿಗೆ ವ್ಯಾಪಿಸುತ್ತದೆ
– ಕೆಲವು ಬಾರಿ ಸೂಕ್ತ ಚಿಕಿತ್ಸೆ ಲಭಿಸದಿದ್ದರೆ ಸಾವು ಸಂಭವಿಸಬಹುದು ಎಚ್ಚರಿಕೆಯಿಂದಿರಿ..!
– ಪ್ರಾಣಿ ಪಕ್ಷಿಗಳು ಕಚ್ಚಿದ ಹಣ್ಣುಗಳನ್ನು ಸೇವಿಸಬೇಡಿ
– ಒಂದು ವೇಳೆ ನೀವು ರೋಗಿಯ ಜೊತೆಗಿದ್ದರೆ ಶುಚಿತ್ವಕ್ಕೆ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಗಮನ ಕೊಡಿ
– ರೋಗಿಯ ಚಿಕಿತ್ಸೆ ವೇಳೆ ಮುಖಕ್ಕೆ ಮಾಸ್ಕ್, ಕೈಗವಚ ಧರಿಸಿ
– ಬಾವಲಿಗಳ ಸಂಖ್ಯೆ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿರುವ ಕಡೆ ಸಂಗ್ರಹಿಸುವ ಶೇಂದಿ, ಪಾನೀಯಗಳನ್ನು ಸೇವಿಸಬೇಡಿ.      ಬಾವಲಿಗಳಿದ್ದ ಬಾವಿಯ ನೀರು ಸೇವನೆ ಹಾಗೂ ಬಾವಲಿಗಳು ಕಚ್ಚಿದ ಮಾವಿನ ಹಣ್ಣು ತಿಂದಿದ್ದರಿಂದ ಈ ರೋಗ ಹರಡಿದೆ ಎನ್ನುವುದು ಸದ್ಯಕ್ಕೆ ಖಚಿತವಾಗಿದೆ. ಬಾವಿಯ ನೀರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ವೈರಸ್ ಪತ್ತೆಯಾಗಿರುವ ಹಿನ್ನೆಲೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಬಾವಿಯನ್ನು ಮುಚ್ಚಿದ್ದೇವೆ ಎಂದು ಶೈಲಜಾ ಸ್ಪಷ್ಟನೆ ನೀಡಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ರೋಗಿಗಳ ಜೊತೆ ಸಂಪರ್ಕದಲ್ಲಿದ್ದ ಎಲ್ಲರ ಆರೋಗ್ಯ ತಪಾಸಣೆ ಮಾಡಲು ಸೂಚನೆ ನೀಡಿದ್ದೇವೆ ಎಂದು ಅವರು ಹೇಳಿದ್ದಾರೆ.

22/05/18, 4:36 PM - Nagendra: Thanks 🤣
22/05/18, 4:36 PM - Theja: I support intercaste marriage
22/05/18, 4:36 PM - Anni jss: Then Varna means what?
22/05/18, 4:36 PM - Theja: Varna is sankrit concept of caste
22/05/18, 4:37 PM - Theja: Including me all should change
It will take 500years
22/05/18, 4:38 PM - Nagendra: Thank God I won't be alive so long having such debates🤣🤣
22/05/18, 4:38 PM - Anni jss: Wrong. Varna means Color.
22/05/18, 4:39 PM - Anni jss: Varna also means kind of work we do.
22/05/18, 4:41 PM - Theja: Yes even Hindu caste was divided based on work
22/05/18, 4:47 PM - Anni jss: U are wrong. Caste was created based on work.
22/05/18, 4:48 PM - Anni jss: They did not create caste and gave work.. until creating caste nobody did work is it?
22/05/18, 4:50 PM - Anni jss: Those who ruled territories came to be known as Kshatriyas, those who taught, preached to people were called Brahmins, those who did carpentry and similar work were called vaishyas, those who cleaned toilets, cleaning work were called shudras
22/05/18, 4:51 PM - Anni jss: If they created caste and then gave work, nobody ruled territories, taught people, grew vegetables is it? Caste create Maadi work divide Maadi Tanaka yaaru Anna tintirlilva?
22/05/18, 4:52 PM - Anni jss: By definition brahmin is not a caste. A brahmin or Brahman is somebody who teaches, who preaches.
22/05/18, 4:53 PM - Anni jss: So all those teachers, could be religious or other, are Brahmins.
22/05/18, 4:55 PM - Theja: Correct
How son of Brahmin became Brahmin if he is not teacher
22/05/18, 4:57 PM - Anni jss: That is what Arun telling. Britishers used this Varna system to create caste to divide India and Indians and fight between them
22/05/18, 4:57 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Correct
22/05/18, 4:57 PM - Anni jss: That's why he is saying, there was not caste system in India earlier and British created it
22/05/18, 4:57 PM - Anni jss: And the same policy is used by Congress is what Arun is telling
22/05/18, 4:58 PM - Anni jss: Or for that matter any party
22/05/18, 4:58 PM - Vishak: Ok but main point banni Congress bjp biddi
22/05/18, 4:58 PM - Anni jss: Yaav point guru
22/05/18, 4:59 PM - Vishak: Y can't ppl Marry
22/05/18, 4:59 PM - Theja: Ok forget party 
Now there is no British
How I am dalit just because I'm born to dalit
22/05/18, 4:59 PM - Anni jss: Brahmin son cannot become a brahmin if he is not a teacher. By the word teacher, don't take the literal meaning as to someone who teaches maths or science. Those times teachings meant religious teachings and preachings
22/05/18, 5:00 PM - Vishak: Theja ur dalit please clean toilet🤣
22/05/18, 5:00 PM - Anni jss: Ask Congress which still followed it from 1947 and asked everybody to fill up religion caste section. They were the ones who continued it.
22/05/18, 5:01 PM - Theja: It's also mistake of people
22/05/18, 5:01 PM - Theja: In matrimony there is no reservation
22/05/18, 5:01 PM - Anni jss: By definition of brahmin, even a moulana or a father is a brahmin. Cos they preach their people and teach them
22/05/18, 5:01 PM - Anni jss: People just got used to it what Britishers did
22/05/18, 5:02 PM - Anni jss: That's why Arun saying Aryans didn't bring in caste system and it was the bristish
22/05/18, 5:03 PM - Anni jss: Simply u guys saying Aryans brought caste system from many many days
22/05/18, 5:04 PM - Anni jss: Just don't go by what someone says. Use ur brain, research and see if what they told is right or not. Read what the people who condemn something say, evaluate and then come to conclusion
22/05/18, 5:05 PM - Anni jss: There are many historians who have dismissed Aryan theory saying, Britishers coined the term Aryan to divide India. Read them, evaluate what pro Aryan theory says and anti Aryan theory says and conclude
22/05/18, 5:05 PM - Theja: Even after Independence it's not only congress.
Why we are still stick to it.
I'm ready to move on.
I feel it should start with mass inter caste marriage
22/05/18, 5:05 PM - Anni jss: Don't mistake that, I am speaking as jnani here. I have read both pro Aryan and anti Aryan theories a bit, not completely
22/05/18, 5:06 PM - Anni jss: It can't. It's not cos of just caste, because of 'paddati' as well
22/05/18, 5:07 PM - Anni jss: Very simple, we madhwas won't marry smartas. Reason, though both are Brahmins, Namma Siddhanta here, Avara siddhanta bere
22/05/18, 5:08 PM - Anni jss: We madhwas don't marry iyengars. Simple reason, iyengars don't treat shiva as God.
22/05/18, 5:08 PM - Anni jss: So there are many many differences between each caste, sub castw leave alone religion
22/05/18, 5:09 PM - Anni jss: We should keep our religion, caste etc at home not in public. Treat everyone equal
22/05/18, 5:21 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Anyone can log a petition in court, why can't dalit log it ask the question or fight for it ??
22/05/18, 5:22 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: You are not ready for change, you are not ready  for BJP without reason, so nindu industry eetara case adre imagine others.

All want a blame on somebody but never wants a change
22/05/18, 5:22 PM - Vishak: Whatever may b reason in past present wat we follow is important
22/05/18, 5:22 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: *industry-ondu
22/05/18, 5:24 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I agree brahmin never shouts that he is Brahmin outside, moreover whatever the traditional ceremony he keeps within family.

How many brahmin do you think go temples daily??
22/05/18, 5:24 PM - Vishak: We are living in 21st century but still discussing religion caste etc
22/05/18, 5:24 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: It's the foolishness of others but blame upper caste
22/05/18, 5:25 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: It's always a shitty debate with you , that's why I reply when teja pings
22/05/18, 5:25 PM - Anni jss: Exactly. 
If someone does pooja at home daily, that itself is a temple.
22/05/18, 5:25 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Yes
22/05/18, 5:27 PM - Vishak: Dude main point is y can't ppl from different caste marry in present age were no one is following any siddatha padditi shit and all. Only watch porn😁
22/05/18, 5:28 PM - Anni jss: Because different people believe in different gods. They can't stop praying to go
22/05/18, 5:28 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: People are getting married panda, it's only you and me are single ....
22/05/18, 5:28 PM - Vishak: 😢 u hit the nail on head
22/05/18, 5:30 PM - Anni jss: Simple difference. U don't worship shiva, then I can't accept you. That person says, Vishnu is the mightiest, the other person doesn't like. So why worry, marry those people who are like minded. That's why people marry in there own caste
22/05/18, 5:30 PM - Anni jss: He hit hammer on ur head
22/05/18, 5:31 PM - Vishak: Who talks all those I am telling the couple's don't care, for them it's like u like 69 or doggy 😄

22/05/18, 5:34 PM - Anni jss: Love marriage is not what I am speaking about.

22/05/18, 5:37 PM - Vishak: How can this happen in India
22/05/18, 5:37 PM - Vishak: I got one more Brahmin friend who married a Reddy
22/05/18, 5:37 PM - Vishak: All can happen

22/05/18, 5:40 PM - Vishak: But dabba matrimonial sites are like promoting more castism

22/05/18, 5:50 PM - Anni jss: Why blame matrimony for what people are following. If they remove caste, there business is gone.

22/05/18, 8:11 PM - Theja: Ok
22/05/18, 8:15 PM - Theja: I feel even in same caste there will be difference. We should celebrate difference. 
So for next generation kids we should advice to see content of character of that girl nothing else.

And one doubt if Rahul Gandhi is bjp pm candidate will you vote bjp.
22/05/18, 8:18 PM - Lola Infosys: In US, kids have to choose religion at age 10 or so. They don't inherit caste or religion from parents. But ya, most of the time they are influenced by parents teachings at home, but atleast choice is given. I think this should be done in India.
22/05/18, 8:18 PM - Lola Infosys: Even I don't like this, just coz I'm born to someone, I'm forced to follow their religion.
22/05/18, 8:19 PM - Lola Infosys: This I have also read.. true
22/05/18, 8:20 PM - Lola Infosys: Arun, explain more 😁

22/05/18, 8:27 PM - Lola Infosys: Religion is just a set of ideas to do daily activities , created by man by experience. I feel all religions shud take only good and combine. But ideally this won't happen
22/05/18, 8:29 PM - Theja: Practically it won't go. But that's my dream.
22/05/18, 8:29 PM - Lola Infosys: Yea
22/05/18, 8:31 PM - Theja: If you see animals they hunt only for food.
But humans do racist,religion,caste based attacks . 
In a way it's required to reduce population

22/05/18, 8:41 PM - Lola Infosys: Jaggesh saying kunni to Prakash Rai 😂😂
22/05/18, 8:43 PM - Lola Infosys: Animals also have divided themselves based on work, some patrol, some for hunting, some stay back for taking care of kids etc. Best example is ants. Same way humans distributed work and gave the works a name. But due to some bad ppl, it turned into wrong meaning over time
22/05/18, 8:59 PM - Theja: Logically wrong
It's just ant not Brahmin ant
22/05/18, 9:02 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: <Media omitted>
22/05/18, 9:11 PM - Lola Infosys: How is it wrong? Some ppl are good at something, so they do that work.
22/05/18, 9:11 PM - Lola Infosys: It's not family biz, based on capability, work is distributed
22/05/18, 9:23 PM - Nagendra: Caste religion n all is like cloths.. I wear clothes I want u wear what u want.. u cant question me what I wear I can't question u want u wear.. as long as I don't hate what u wear it should all be fine.. u can't force anyone to wear this wear that.. simple..
22/05/18, 9:27 PM - Nagendra: Marriage is much more personal than caste religion.. everyone has right to choose whom they want to marry.. so it's illogical to say everyone should go for intercaste marriage... 

U can say people shouldn't oppose intercaste marriage if guy n girl likes.. 

U can't say every must do intercaste marriage.. if u say this u r sounding like Hitler
22/05/18, 9:31 PM - Nagendra: That's y humans r known to be evolved .. if we were to think like animals would have killed u long back 🤣
22/05/18, 9:34 PM - Lola Infosys: 😂
22/05/18, 9:36 PM - Nagendra: This is also wrong .. male lion kills male lion to establish territory to impress female lion for sex.. tiger kills tigers for territory.. dog after giving birth eats a puppy sometimes..
22/05/18, 9:36 PM - Theja: World population is higher proportion with your thinking. You feel it's normal. 
My view different I want to walk nude
22/05/18, 9:38 PM - Theja: I am already parent and when we become parent. We should not advice from childhood to love or arrange marry in our castes

I have seen many cases parents advice.insane
22/05/18, 9:40 PM - Lola Infosys: Earlier Indian culture didn't have clothes. Best example is God idols, only basic body is covered. Even female gods also. Later on it became a trend
22/05/18, 9:40 PM - Anni jss: No. If rg becomes BJP candidate and modi becomes Congress candidate, I will vote congress

22/05/18, 11:15 PM - Vishak: Disclaimer: I am no Bhakt, I am no Congi, I am no AAPtard... I make my voting decisions based on the candidate in my locality... I believe from the bottom of my heart that no political party is clean...

What fascinates me is the posts on Facebook... how educated people rant their support for their preferred party almost as though the opposition is evil and their preferred party is holy... They are all the same... They are all power hungry parasites... 

Don't waste your energy in building hate... I see people arguing with friends, making nasty comments, insulting religions... what do you get out of it... NOTHING!

What do you lose - friends & respect!

The impact of all this, stupidity thrives in our country... Politicians and media only continue to benefit by dividing us and there is no accountability on the real issues...

23/05/18, 12:45 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: *The Curd Rice...*

Curd Rice is the only Indian food which releases a Chemical called Tryptophan in Brain. Indians alone take Curd as Curd. But western world takes it as Yogurt, which has got Sugar too, and sugar will not calm your Brain, but increase Glucose level and will put one to more restlessness.  Sugar is dangerous for the Balance of Neural activity. It triggers hyperactivity.

But Curd rice is the only food which can release Tryptophan in Brain, which calms down and brings a cool thinking, and your neurons are recharged with a mild rest because of Tryptophan. ( In Sanskrit there's  a word for this Chemical, as Thrupthophan, Thrupthi means Satisfaction).

*Curd rice is the Scientific reason for the success of Many Indians, as it the Best brain food which activates the Brain in a balanced manner for a Tropical climate!*

*Mosaranna ...*🍚 JaiHo  :))))
