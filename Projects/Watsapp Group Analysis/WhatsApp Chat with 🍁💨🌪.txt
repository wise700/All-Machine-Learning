22/12/16, 3:20 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I am deeply disturbed after seeing how the actors of Thithi have been recently misused and misappropriated in recent Kannada films. They have been made to copy their own roles that they played in Thithi, not even changing their character names - for which they won international fame as well as appreciation - in such a way that one can now only cringe at the crassness and vulgarity of the jokes and the manner in which they have been depicted. 
I feel helpless because I can do nothing to stop this. But I also feel sad that these nonprofessional actors are being used in this way. 
In ‘Thithi’ these people played characters true to life, and the filmmaking team as well as producers really did everything to care for the actors, and to preserve their image as well as self respect. In Thithi we tried to show the world the talent and humanity of these people. They were not a joke. I hope the directors and producers of the upcoming Kannada films will take care in the same way. 
Lastly, I request NOT to be credited in any of these films using the actors from ‘Thithi’ - I do not want special thanks, or any such acknowledgement. I have absolutely nothing to do with these films, and do not want to be associated with them in any way even indirectly - as any such acknowledgement would be false.  
I feel like crying.

24/12/16, 10:42 PM - Lola Infosys: For those r familiar with Muthu's Fish head curry..resturant in singapore..Last Friday, I took a French to Muthu Fish Head Restaurant. I noticed that the Indian waiter had a spoon in his shirt pocket. 

I looked around and saw all the Indian waiters had spoons in their pockets.

When the waiter came I inquired, "Why do you place the spoon in your pocket?" 

He explained, "The boss hired Accenture Consulting to reengineer our processes. They discovered the spoon was the most frequently dropped utensil. Approximately 3 spoons per table per hour are dropped. If our staff carry spoons, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift." 

As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he replaced it with his spare one.

"I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now." 

I was impressed. I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the Indian waiter's fly. Looking around, I saw that all of the Indian waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. I asked the waiter, "Excuse me, can you tell me why you have that string there?"

Then the Indian waiter lowered his voice. "Not everyone is so observant.  Accenture also suggested we can save time in the restroom. By tying this string to the tip of our manhood, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 45%."

I asked quietly, "After you get it out, how do you put it back?"

He whispered, "_We use the spoon_."🙏🏼😜

ಆ ಕಾರು ಓನರ್ ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಚಿಕಿತ್ಸೆಮಾಡಿಸಿ
ಮನೆಗೆ ತೆರಳಿ ಒಂದು ಪಂಜರದಲ್ಲಿ ಇಡುತ್ತಾನೆ,
ಮರುದಿನ ಪಾರಿವಾಳಕ್ಕೆ ಎಚ್ಚರ ಆಗುತ್ತದೆ!
ಆಗ ಮನಸ್ಸಲ್ಲಿ ಹೀಗಂದುಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತದೆ

10/01/17, 10:29 PM - Vishak: *SAP India CEO Ranjan Das Dies After Gym Workout*       

Ranjan Das, CEO and MD of SAP-Indian subcontinent died after a massive cardiac arrest in Mumbai recently.
One of the youngest CEOs, he was only 42.

What killed Ranjan Das?

He was very active in sports, was a fitness freak and a marathon runner.

After his workout, he collapsed with a massive heart attack and died. He is survived by his wife and two very young kids.

It was certainly a wake-up call for corporate India. However, it was even more disastrous for runners.

The question arises as  to why an exceptionally active, athletic person succumbed to a heart attack at 42 years of age.

What is the real reason?

Everyone missed out a small line in the reports that Ranjan used to manage with 4-5 hours of sleep.

In an earlier interview of Ranjan on NDTV in the program ‘Boss' day out’, Ranjan Das himself admitted that he sleeps less and would love to get more sleep. 

Short sleep duration (<5 or 5-6 hours) increases risk for high BP by 350% to 500% compared to those who slept longer than 6 hours per night.

Young people (25-49 years of age) are twice as likely to get high BP if they sleep less.

Individuals who sleep less than 5 hours a night have a 3-fold increased  risk of heart attacks.

Just one night of sleep loss increases very toxic substances in body such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and C-reactive protein (CRP). They also cause cancer, arthritis and heart disease.

Sleeping for <=5 hours per night leads to 39% increase in heart disease. Sleeping for <=6 hours per night leads to 8% increase in heart disease.

What is ideal sleep?

In brief, sleep is composed of two stages: REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and  non-REM. The former helps in mental consolidation while the latter helps in physical repair and rebuilding.

No wonder when one wakes up with an alarm clock after 5-6  hours of sleep, he/she is mentally irritable throughout the day (lack of REM sleep).

And if somebody has slept for less than 5 hours, the body is in a complete physical mess (lack of non-REM sleep), the person is tired throughout the day and immunity is way down.

CONCLUSION:
Barring stress control, Ranjan Das did everything right: eating proper food, exercising, maintaining proper weight. But he missed getting proper and adequate sleep, minimum 7 hours. That killed him.

We are playing with fire if we are sleeping less than 7 hours even if we have low stress. 

Do not set your alarm clock under 7 hours.

Ranjan Das is not alone. 

Do Share it with all the Good People In ur Life...😊

Attachment is not when two people chat day & night ...

Attachment is not when two people can't live without each other ...

16/01/17, 4:13 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: ಖ್ಯಾತ ಕಾದಂಬರಿಕಾರ ಡಾ. ಎಸ್‌.ಎಲ್‌. ಭೈರಪ್ಪ ಅವರ ಹೊಸ ಕಾದಂಬರಿ ‘ಉತ್ತರಕಾಂಡ’ದ ಬಿಡುಗಡೆಗೆ ಮುನ್ನವೇ ಎರಡನೇ ಮುದ್ರಣ ಆರಂಭವಾಗಿದೆ.‘ಕಾದಂಬರಿಗೆ ಓದುಗರಿಂದ ಬೇಡಿಕೆ ಹೆಚ್ಚಾಗಿದೆ. ಹೀಗಾಗಿ ಮಾರಾಟಗಾರರು ಈ ಮೊದಲು  ಸಲ್ಲಿಸಿದ್ದ ಬೇಡಿಕೆಗಿಂತ ದುಪ್ಪಟ್ಟು ಕೃತಿಗಳನ್ನು ಕಳುಹಿಸುವಂತೆ ಕೇಳುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ.

ಮೂವತ್ತು ಪುಸ್ತಕಕ್ಕೆ ಬೇಡಿಕೆ ಸಲ್ಲಿಸಿದ್ದವರು, ನೂರು ಪುಸ್ತಕ ಬೇಕೆಂದು ಕೇಳುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಬೇಡಿಕೆಯನ್ನು ಗಮನದಲ್ಲಿರಿಸಿಕೊಂಡು ಈಗಾಗಲೇ ಎರಡನೆಯ ಮುದ್ರಣ ಪ್ರಾರಂಭಿಸಲಾಗಿದೆ’ ಎಂದು ಪ್ರಕಾಶನ ಸಂಸ್ಥೆ ‘ಸಾಹಿತ್ಯ ಭಂಡಾರ’ದ ಮಾಲೀಕ ರಾಜ ‘ಪ್ರಜಾವಾಣಿ’ಗೆ ತಿಳಿಸಿದರು.

‘ಸೋಮವಾರ ಬೆಳಿಗ್ಗೆ 10 ಗಂಟೆಯಿಂದ ಪುಸ್ತಕಗಳು ಖರೀದಿಗೆ ಲಭ್ಯವಾಗಲಿವೆ. ಬೀದರ್‌, ಕಾಸರಗೋಡು ಮುಂತಾದ ಪ್ರದೇಶಗಳಿಂದಲೂ ಬೇಡಿಕೆ ಇದೆ. ಸೋಮವಾರ 2ನೇ  ಮುದ್ರಣ ಕೈಸೇರಲಿದೆ’ ಎಂದರು.

‘ಭೈರಪ್ಪ ಅವರ ಈ ಹಿಂದಿನ ಕಾದಂಬರಿಗಳಾದ ‘ಆವರಣ’, ‘ಕವಲು’, ‘ಯಾನ’ ಕೃತಿಗಳಿಗೂ ಅಧಿಕ ಬೇಡಿಕೆ ಬಂದಿತ್ತು. ‘ಯಾನ’ ಬಿಡುಗಡೆಯಾದ ಸತತ ಮೂರು ದಿನ ಮೂರು ಮುದ್ರಣ ಕಂಡಿತ್ತು. ಈ ಅನುಭವ ಮತ್ತು ನಿರೀಕ್ಷೆಗಳೊಂದಿಗೆ ‘ಉತ್ತರಕಾಂಡ’ವನ್ನು ಮುದ್ರಿಸಲಾಗಿತ್ತು. ಆದರೆ, ಅದಕ್ಕೂ ಮೀರಿದ ಸ್ಪಂದನೆ ಓದುಗರಿಂದ ಮತ್ತು ಮಾರಾಟಗಾರರಿಂದ ವ್ಯಕ್ತವಾಗಿದೆ’ ಎಂದು ಅವರು ತಿಳಿಸಿದರು.

‘ಪ್ರಕಾಶಕರಾಗಿ ನಮ್ಮ ಮೇಲೆ ಒತ್ತಡ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿದೆ. ಆದರೆ, ಇದು ನಮ್ಮ ಪಾಲಿಗೆ ಖುಷಿಯ ಕೆಲಸ. ಕನ್ನಡದ ಒಬ್ಬ ಲೇಖಕರಿಗೆ ಈ ರೀತಿಯ ಬೇಡಿಕೆ ಇದೆ ಎಂಬ ಸಂತಸ ಒಂದಾದರೆ, ಆ ಲೇಖಕರ ಕಾದಂಬರಿಗಳ ಪ್ರಕಾಶಕರು ನಾವು ಎಂಬ ಹೆಮ್ಮೆ ನಮ್ಮದು. ಜನರು ಸೈದ್ಧಾಂತಿಕ ಧೋರಣೆ, ಇಸಂಗಳನ್ನು ಬಿಟ್ಟು ಇಷ್ಟಪಟ್ಟು ಖರೀದಿಸುತ್ತಿರುವುದು ವಿಶೇಷ’ ಎಂದು  ಹೇಳಿದರು.

ಜಲ್ಲಿಕಟ್ಟುನಲ್ಲಿ ಮಾತುಬಾರದ ಗೂಳಿಯೊಡನೆ ಕೆಲ ಗಂಟೆಗಳ ಹೋರಾಟ.

"ತಾಳಿ ಕಟ್ಟು"ವಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಮಾತನಾಡುವ ಕಾಳಿಯೊಡನೆ ಜನ್ಮಪೂರ್ತಿ ಪರದಾಟ।।

A beautiful speech by Sundar Pichai - an IIT-MIT Alumnus

The cockroach theory for self development👍
     
At a restaurant, a cockroach suddenly flew from somewhere and  sat on a lady. 

She started screaming out of fear. 

With a panic stricken face and trembling voice, she started jumping, with both her hands desperately trying to get rid of the cockroach.

Her reaction was contagious, as everyone in her group also got panicky.

The lady finally managed to push the cockroach away but ...it landed on another lady in the group.

Now, it was the turn of the other lady in the group to continue the drama.

The waiter rushed forward to their rescue.

In the relay of throwing, the cockroach next fell upon the waiter.

The waiter stood firm, composed himself and observed the behavior of the cockroach on his shirt.

When he was confident enough, he grabbed it with his fingers and threw it out of the restaurant.

Sipping my coffee and watching the amusement, the antenna of my mind picked up a few thoughts and started wondering, was the cockroach  responsible for their histrionic behavior?

If so, then why was the waiter not disturbed?

He handled it near to perfection, without any chaos.

It is not the cockroach, but the inability of those people to handle the disturbance caused by the cockroach, that disturbed the ladies.

I realized that, it is not the shouting of my father or my boss or my wife that disturbs me, but it's my inability to handle the disturbances caused by their shouting that disturbs me.

It's not the traffic jams on the road that disturbs me, but my inability to handle the disturbance caused by the traffic jam that disturbs me.

More than the problem, it's my reaction to the problem that creates chaos in my life.

Lessons learnt from the story:

I understood, I should not react in life.
I should always respond.

The women reacted, whereas the waiter responded.

Reactions are always instinctive whereas responses are always well thought of.

A beautiful way to understand............LIFE.

Person who is HAPPY is not because Everything is RIGHT in his Life..

He is HAPPY because his Attitude towards Everything in his Life is Right..!!,,,,,,,

🌟🌟 Really beautiful 🌟🌟

🔸ಹೆಂಡತಿ ಜೊತೆ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಸಮಯ ಮಾತನಾಡುವುದರಿಂದ ಆ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಯ tension ಕಡಿಮೆಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.
🔹Heart attack ನ ಸಂಭವ 80% ಕಡಿಮೆಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.
🔹ಮನಸ್ಸು 90% relax ಆಗುತ್ತದೆ.
🔹Stress 95% ನಷ್ಟು ಕಡಿಮೆಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.

ಆದರೆ ಹೆಂಡತಿ ಯಾರದು ಎಂಬುದರ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಸಂಸ್ಥೆಯಿಂದ ಯಾವ ಮಾಹಿತಿಯೂ ಉಪಲಬ್ಧವಾಗಿಲ್ಲ. 😀😜

29/01/17, 6:38 PM - Lola Infosys: School reunion Special:
Have you ever been guilty of looking at others your own age and thinking, "surely I can't look that old.". Well . . . you'll love this one..The stuff is from a lady called Archana

"My name is Archana. I was sitting in the waiting room for my first appointment with a new dentist.

I noticed his BDS degree on the wall, which bore his full name.

Suddenly, I remembered a tall , handsome, dark-haired boy with the same name had been in my high school class some 25-odd years ago.

Could he be the same guy that I had a secret crush on, way back then?

Upon seeing him, however, I quickly discarded any such thought. This balding, gray-haired man with the deeply lined face was way too old to have been my classmate.

After he examined my teeth, I asked him if he had attended St Xavier's high school.

"Yes. yes, I did.' he gleamed with pride.

"When did you graduate?" I asked.

He answered, "In 1987. Why do you ask?"

"You were in my class!!!!", I exclaimed.

He looked at me closely.

Then, that ugly, old, bald,
wrinkled faced, gray-haired,
decrepit, idiot, asked,

"What subject did you teach" ?"

*If Modi says that after visiting toilet everyone must wash hands with soap .

*What would the opposition leaders say.
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

*Kejriwal-* Modi has taken money from the soap manufacturing companies .

*Rahul Gandhi-* Modi wants the poor people to spend their money to wash their hands for his own" SWACHH BHARAT" scheme.

Owaisi-* I will not wash hands as it is not written in the constitution . Even if you keep knife in my neck I will not wash.

*Mayawati.* Dalit should get free soap and reservation once a week to wash their hands.

*Kapil Sibal-* My toilet, my shit, my hands why should I wash my hands ?

*Mulayam-* As long as I am there, people of U.P. need not wash their hands.

*Giriraj-*  Those who don't want to wash they should go to Pakistan.

Last but the best:

And *Momata Banarjee* - Conspiracy to close all hospitals.

THE TRUE STATE OF INDIAN POLITICS!! 
I am proud of my India

07/02/17, 7:46 PM - Anni jss: A man  boards a Jet Airways flight from Delhi to Mumbai and takes his seat.

As he settles in, he glances up and sees a gorgeous woman boarding the  

plane. He soon realizes she's heading straight towards his seat.

 

Low and behold, she takes the seat right next to his.

 

 Eager to strike up a conversation, he asks "Business trip or vacation?"

 She turns, smiles, and says, "Business. I'm going to the annual Sexologists Convention."

 He swallows hard. Here is the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen, sitting next to him, and she's a sexologist! Struggling to contain his excitement and maintain his composure,

 He calmly asks, "What's your business role at this convention?"

 

 "Lecturer," she says, "I use my experience to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality."

 "Really?" he says, swallowing hard. "What m-m-m-myths are those?"

 

 "Well," she explains, "one popular myth is that African men are the best endowed when, in fact, it's the Malayalee who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, whereas actually it is the Bengali. However, we have found that the best potential lover in all categories is the Sardar." 

 Suddenly, the woman becomes a little uncomfortable and blushes. "I'm sorry," she says, "I shouldn't be discussing this with you. I don't even know  your name!" 

 "Joginder!" the man blurts out. "Joginder Banerjee!

 But all my friends call me Kuttappan Nair!"

15/02/17, 10:04 AM - Lola Infosys: In a major relief to lakhs of cardiac patients, the Modi government on Tuesday cut prices of life-saving coronary stents by up to 85 per cent by capping them at Rs 7,260 for bare metal ones and Rs 29,600 for drug eluting variety.
The maximum retail price of bare metal stents (BMS) and drug eluting stents (DES) will be Rs 7,623 and Rs 31,080, respectively, inclusive of VAT and other local taxes. The new prices are applicable with immediate effect, Chemical and Fertiliser Minister Ananth Kumar said while announcing the decision.
Earlier, the average maximum retail price (MRP) for BMS was Rs 45,000 and for DES, it was Rs 1.21 lakh. The government has asked the companies to change the MRP of the existing stock.
A coronary stent is a tube-shaped device placed in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. It keeps the arteries open in the treatment of coronary heart diseases.
“We want to stop the menace of over-pricing of coronary stents in various hospitals. After careful consideration and after having inputs from various stakeholders, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has decided to fix the ceiling prices for cardiac stents,” he said.
The minister said the capping of the stent price will result in saving of Rs 80,000-90,000 per piece and gross relief of Rs 4,450 crore in a year for cardiac patients.
The companies will have to revise the price of the existing stock being sold in the market, he said, adding that stringent action will be taken against hospitals and suppliers for overcharging.
The health ministry has been told to take steps to curb unethical practices by hospitals such as charging more from patients for procedure, treatment and post-care, to recover their losses due to reduction in stent prices, he noted.
In a notification issued on this issue, NPPA said: “… it was found that huge unethical mark-ups are charged at each stage in the supply chain of coronary stents resulting in irrational, restrictive and exorbitant prices in a failed market system driven by information asymmetry between patients and doctors, pushing patients to financial misery.”
Under such extraordinary circumstances, there is an urgent necessity, in public interest, to fix ceiling price of coronary stents to bring respite to the patients, it added.
The Modi government had included coronary stents in the national list of essential medicines (NLEM), 2015, in July 2016 and in the first Schedule of the Drug Prices Control Order (DPCO), 2013, in December 2016.
Certainly now people would love to say Har Har Modi Ghar Ghar Modi!

21/02/17, 3:36 PM - Ba: Well asked, lemme TRY to explain with all the brain I have, which I think I have one. Life, as itself doesn't have a purpose, we, man and women are designed to give purpose to the life, to make it worth living, to make it worth living the way we want, to make it worth living the happy way we want. Given everything u want alone cannot make u happy, well happy and life are enemies, they always fight each other, that's why happy life is always ahead of us and we always run to get it, those are split roads, and when u decide on the purpose of life, the happy and the life meet together in an eternal sea, that's where u sail, sail and sail !

got an expensive pen as a gift from her boss.

She sent him a 'Thank you note' by email.

Boss’s wife read the email and filed for divorce.

The email said: Your penis wonderful and I enjoyed using it last night. It has extra ordinary smooth flow and a firm stroke. I loved its perfect size and grip. Felt like I was in heaven when using it.Thanks a lot.

08/03/17, 2:16 PM - Lola Infosys: *Q*:- _*What's wrong with Cashless Transaction*_..?

*A*:- _Sir think that a 100 rupee note is circulated 1,00,000 times it will have the same value, nobody gets any commission_.

_But if it is circulated through cashless transactions, each transaction fetches *2.5%* commission, that means 1,00,000 times 2.5% = 2500% i.e. Rs. 2,50,000 (Rs. Two Lakhs fifty thousand Rupees) to service providers like Paytm or Jio Money etc. *Just for hundred rupees*_. 

_So, it's a perpetual golden egg laying goose gifted to the gang_.                               

_That's why this is the *Mother of all scams* Very important statistics please read & understand, no politics in this_.                                                                              

*Do you know*...

1) _Debit Cards charge between 0.5% to 1% to the retailer Or money receiver for every transaction_.

2) _Credit Cards charge beteen 1.5%-2.5% to the retailer of the money receiver for every transaction_.

3) _PayTM/Freecharge/ Jio Money and other E-wallets charger 2.5% -3.5% when you want to transfer your e-wallet money into your bank a/c_.

_RBI data shows that every month around 2.25 lakh crore (Anually Rs 25 -30 lakh crores) is withdrawn from ATM's across India. And it is estimated that along with bank withdrawals, a total of Rs 75 lakh crore is withdrawn ( both banks and ATMs) on a yearly basis. All this is accounted/tax-payed money which is withdrawn from banks. Currently, just 3% of transactions are in electronic mode_...

_If this 75 lakh crore is converted into a *#cashlesseconomy*, look at how much the companies will earn.. (75 lakh crores times 2% average)  Rs 1.5 lakh crore per year!_... 
*NO KIDDING!*

_*This is the biggest open scam. Direct benefit for Corporates like Reliance, PayTM, e-Banks etc. of Rs 1.5 lakh crores per year*_...

_This makes me wonder, was Demonetization done to end black money or was it actually done to benefit Corporates_?

_*I request you all to share this important eye opening message*_.

A  777 was lumbering along when a cocky F-16 flashed by. 

The jet pilot decided to show off. The fighter jock told the 777 pilot, “Watch this!”  And promptly went into a barrel roll followed by a steep climb. He then finished with a sonic boom as he broke the sound barrier.
   
The F-16 pilot asked the 777 pilot what he thought of that?  
 
The 777 pilot said, “That was impressive, but watch this!”
The 777 droned along for about 5 minutes and then the 777 pilot came back on and said, “What did you think of that?”

Puzzled, the F-16 pilot asked, “What the heck did you do?” 

The 777 pilot chuckled and said,
“I stood up, stretched my legs, walked  to the back, used the toilet, then got a cup of coffee and a cinnamon roll n secure a date for the next 3 nights in a five star hotel paid for by the company"

When you are young & foolish - speed & flash may seem like a good thing! 

When you get older & smarter - comfort & dullness is not such a bad thing! 
It's called S.O.S. -
Slower, Older and Smarter!

Dedicated to all my friends in the  the S.O.S. category.

13/03/17, 9:37 PM - Vishak: SBI NEW RULES FROM 1st APRIL'17

1. Minimum 3 times deposit free in your account, After more then 3 times deposit you will pay 50/- per deposit.
2. Minimum 5000/- balance maintain in metro city branch account holder.
3. Minimum 3000/- balance maintain in city/town branch account holder
4. Minimum 2000/- balance maintain in semi urban area branch account holder.
5. Minimum 1000/- balance maintain in villages branch account holder
6. If you not maintain minimum amount in your account you will pay up to 200/- + extra surcharge.(depending on how many days)
7. SBI ATM free for 5 times use, after 5 times you will pay 10/- per transactions.
8. Other bank ATM free for 3 times use, after 3 times you will pay 20/- per transactions.
9. Unlimited SBI ATM use without any charges, If you maintain 25000/- in your SBI savings account.
10. Unlimited SBI & OTHER BANK ATM use without any charges, If you maintain 100000/- in your SBI savings account
11. 15/- SMS charge you will pay after 3 months, (SMS charge free, If you maintain 25000/- in your SBI savings account)

There is a PROTEST AGAINST  TRANSACTION FEES AND DECREASING RATE OF INTEREST ON OUR DEPOSITS.
Let the banks also experience the public power. They are thieves. Imagine . To withdraw your own money you have to pay service charge to the Bank and you pay Service Tax on the Service Charge to the Govt. 

To this end April 06, 2017 will be a no transaction day  with banks. If they don't rollback. Let's plan April 24,25,26, 2017  as no transaction days. We will continue this until there is no roll back on service charges . 

Keep spreading this message every 5 days to all ur FB , mails and W App contacts.

It is difficult but not impossible otherwise banks will go on adding various  new charges now and then. RBI Governer is a puppet and has no control nor understands the economics. 
 
This protest is for our benefit to control banks to adding new charges.  

Let's come together and show the
POWER OF UNITY.

Banks have started to increase transaction fee!

Service tax has gone up big time and will increase even more!

We were taxed for earning money.
We are taxed for spending money. 
We were taxed for hoarding money.
We are taxed for withdrawing money.
We are taxed for depositing money.
We are taxed for service money
We are taxed (cess)for education
We are taxed for Swatch Bharat
We are taxed for purchase 
We are taxed for sales
We are taxed for manufacturing 
We are taxed for public Utility 
Earning is a crime. 
Saving is a crime. 
Spending is a crime. 
Donating to Political Parties is the only good act. 
😡😡😡

He fixed Rs. 50/- as entry fee nobody turned up then he reduced it to 25/- even though nobody turned then made it 20/- no use, later 15/-, 10/- no use. He decided to make it "Entry free" the next minute the Zoo was over crowded with lots of people. He closed the gates and displayed house full board & let the Tiger free inside the Zoo, crowd started rushing towards the gates & were shocked to see the Exit fees of Rs. 303/-. This Zoo name is "JIO"

17/03/17, 12:53 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: From Student No 1 to Yamadonga, Rajamouli was just another Telugu director giving hit films with commercial masalas! Just 3 films made him hot shot director !!! 

In every phase of his filmography, Shankar has always gone to different levels in technical standards & in fact opened the gateway to graphics, vfx & introduced the green mat technology to Indian cinema ! 

Shankar is always the avant-garde in grandeur & trend setter in making the producers believe big budgets work in regional cinema provided the content is also strong! 

Rajamouli earlier films Simhadri, Yamadonga, Sye very outdated feel to watch in TV now 😣 but Shankar's Indian mudhalvan jeans anniyan, boys are evergreen products anyday..  Rajamouli can no way come near Shankar...

Just wait for 2.0🤖... it will b A GIANT LEAP for INDIAN CINEMA 🎬🎬 content wise as well as grandeur wise...

22/03/17, 7:49 AM - Lola Infosys: Once a Project Manager was travelling by train from Mumbai to Bangalore! 

When the train started, He was traveling alone in the AC-I coupe.

Some time later, a Beautiful lady came and sat in the opposite berth! 

Manager was pleasantly Happy

The lady kept smiling at him...
This made him even more Happier ☺☺

Then she went and sat next to him.... 
he was bubbling with Joy😊😍

She then leant towards him and whispered in his ear...

"Hand over all your cash, cards and mobile phone to me , else I will shout loudly and tell everybody that you are  harassing and misbehaving with me" 

Manager stared blankly at her

He took out a paper and a pen from his bag and wrote " I am sorry, I can not hear or speak... Please write on this paper whatever you want to say" 

The lady wrote everything what she said earlier and gave it to him! 

Manager took her note, kept it nicely in his pocket...
got up and told her in clear tones...
*Now shout & scream !!*

Moral of the story : 

*DOCUMENTATION IS VERY IMPORTANT*😜

23/03/17, 5:51 PM - Lola Infosys: Ice-cream update - Amul has won a lawsuit against Walls, Kwality and some other branded icecream makers. They can no longer sell their products as icecream. Hence the new marketing name is 'frozen desserts'. If you check labels of items sold as frozen desserts it does say hydrogenated vegetable oil which is dalda! So if its frozen dessert, its definately dalda. You can check the packs. This is ice cream season. All our children love to eat it, so be aware that AMUL is the only ice cream manufacturer who makes icecream from milk not from vegetable fats..
Just see this..👇👇

How did St Thomas convert Keralites to Christianity?      
           
St Thomas said - Jesus healed the sick.
Mallus didn't believe.

He said - Jesus died for you.
Mallus said - Oh pinne!

He said - Jesus fed 5000 people from 5 loaves and 2 fishes.
Mallus said - Podaa!

Then he said - Jesus converted water to wine.

In the next 48 hours, 43% Malayalees converted to Christianity.       😂. 🍻

31/03/17, 3:42 PM - Lola Infosys: A man had a voice automated robot car that does anything he tells to it He was very  proud that the car could do without mistakes.

One day, his wife told him to tell the car to go and pick the children from school.

The man agreed said to the car...
Car, go and bring my children from school.

The car went and 

Several hours later 



outside they saw the car coming with an overload of children.
and said... "These are your children sir..!"

In the car were their Landlady's two daughters, his wife's best friend's daughter, his secretary's son and their neighbours two sons.

The Wife in full anger😡...
Don't tell me all these are your children..??

The man asked her calmly...
First you tell me why our children are not in the car..😡😡😡??

Annual income =4,44,000

We request the Government to increase the tax exemption limit to 4.5 lakhs so that our Momin Brothers can pelt stones and breed rapidly without any fear of being raided by IT department.

02/04/17, 1:36 PM - Vishak: How an increasing Muslim population impacts that society. Dr Peter Hammond postulates and the empirical data confirms the theory.

As long as the Muslim population remains around or under 2% in any given country, they will be for the most part be regarded as a peace-loving minority, and not as a threat to other citizens.
This is the case in:

United States -- Muslim 0.6%
Australia -- Muslim 1.5%
Canada -- Muslim 1.9%
China -- Muslim 1.8%
Italy -- Muslim 1.5%
Norway -- Muslim 1.8%

At 2% to 5%, they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, often with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs.

This is happening in:
Denmark -- Muslim 2%
Germany -- Muslim 3.7%
United Kingdom -- Muslim 2.7%
Spain -- Muslim 4%
Thailand -- Muslim 4.6%

From 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population. For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature halal on their shelves -- along with threats for failure to comply. This is occurring in:

France -- Muslim 8%
Philippines -- 5%
Sweden -- Muslim 5%
Switzerland -- Muslim 4.3%
The Netherlands -- Muslim 5.5%
Trinidad & Tobago -- Muslim 5.8%

At this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to rule themselves (within their ghettos) under Sharia, the Islamic Law. The ultimate goal of Islamists is to establish Sharia law over the entire world.

When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions. In Paris , we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam , with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam. Such tensions are seen daily, particularly in Muslim sections, in:

Guyana -- Muslim 10%
India -- Muslim 13.4%
Israel -- Muslim 16%
Kenya -- Muslim 10%
Russia -- Muslim 15%

After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues, such as in:

Ethiopia -- Muslim 32.8%
At 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare, such as in:
Bosnia -- Muslim 40%
Chad -- Muslim 53.1%
Lebanon -- Muslim 59.7%

From 60%, nations experience unfettered persecution of non-believers of all other religions (including non-conforming Muslims), sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon, and Jizya, the tax placed on infidels, such as in:
Albania -- Muslim 70%
Malaysia -- Muslim 60.4%
Qatar -- Muslim 77.5%
Sudan -- Muslim 70%

After 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out the infidels, and move toward 100% Muslim, such as has been experienced and in some ways is on-going in:
Bangladesh -- Muslim 83%
Egypt -- Muslim 90%
Gaza -- Muslim 98.7%
Indonesia -- Muslim 86.1%
Iran -- Muslim 98%
Iraq -- Muslim 96%
Jordan -- Muslim 92%
Morocco -- Muslim 98.7%
Pakistan -- Muslim 97%
Palestine -- Muslim 99%
Syria -- Muslim 90%
Tajikistan -- Muslim 90%
Turkey -- Muslim 99.8%
United Arab Emirates -- Muslim 96%

100% will usher in the peace of 'Dar-es-Salaam' -- the Islamic House of Peace. Here there's supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrasses are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word, such as in:

Afghanistan -- Muslim 100%
Saudi Arabia -- Muslim 100%
Somalia -- Muslim 100%
Yemen -- Muslim 100%

Unfortunately, peace is never achieved, as in these 100% states the most radical Muslims intimidate and spew hatred, and satisfy their blood lust by killing less radical Muslims, for a variety of reasons.

05/04/17, 11:58 PM - Anni jss: We felt our website is not a site which a person looks every day.. our site is something a person looks into only when he is need of.. so we felt if a person gets what he wants, then why we need to beautify it and looks only for functionality and information as u said.. but yes we have a point in mind to make it look beautiful, but depends on market response
05/04/17, 11:58 PM - Anni jss: Vritty in Sanskrit means EVENT 🙂

06/04/17, 12:01 AM - Anni jss: We have quite a lot of points ready to be implemented.. but we are waiting to evaluate market response.. then see which one to take priority as and then implement

06/04/17, 6:06 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: A wife left to her Mom's place for vacation yesterday, when the husband was at work. When the husband reached home, found this note stucked on the television.  
.
.
.
.
.
.
.

I am going to My Mom's Place for 6-7 days with kids &
These are the instructions and warnings for you:

1 - No need to call your friends and cousins. 
Last time I got 4 large pizza bills beneath the sofa... 

2 - Don't forget mobile on the soap holder in the bathroom like last time... 
Why would anyone need a mobile in the bathroom.?? 

3 - Keep your specs in the box.. 
Last time around it was found in the refrigerator. 

4 - Salary already paid to maid. 
No need to be extra generous.

5 - Don't disturb neighbors early in the morning asking if they have got newspaper or not?? 
Our newspaper vendor is different from theirs.. 
And our laundry person and milkman are also different. 

6 - Your Underwear are on left side of wardrobe and on right side are kids'...
Like last time, don't say I was uncomfortable at work....

7 - All reports have been checked and you are alright.  
No need to go to that young lady doctor again and again.  

8 - My sister and Bhabhi's birthdays have  gone last month which you already attended.  
No need to go to them at midnight and wish belated happy birthday.. 

9 - Have cut off WiFi for 10 days. 
So sleep early.... 

10 - Stop smiling and being happy... 
as Mrs. Khanna, Mrs. Avasthi, Mrs. Kulkarni, Mrs. Trivedi, Mrs. Ansari, Mrs. Rastogi, Mrs. Chatteerjee... 
They all will be out of station in this period.... 

11. Do not knock on the doors of that KALMUHI Priya, next door, on pretext of asking Sugar milk coffee powder or so one. I stocked all these in kitchen cabinet.  

And last but not the least.

12 - Don't try to be oversmart.. 
I  may back any moment without informing you 

.
.
.
Happy Vacation

08/04/17, 6:21 PM - Ba: The 4 hour erection...

I went to a chemist store and asked to talk to a male pharmacist. 

The woman I spoke to said she was the only pharmacist and since she and her sister owned the store, there were no male employees. 

She asked if she could help me.

I said that I really would have preferred to speak with a male pharmacist. She assured me that she was completely professional and whatever it was that I needed to discuss, I could be confident that she would treat me with a high level of professionalism.

I reluctantly agreed and began by saying, "As a shy man, this is tough for me to discuss, but here goes. I get erections every day that last more than four hours. This condition causes me a lot of problems and severe embarrassment. I was wondering what you could give me for it."

The pharmacist said, "Just a minute, I'll talk to my sister."

When she returned, she said, "We discussed it at length and this is the absolute best we can do:

    * 1/3rd ownership in the store
    * a company car
    * A furnished house 
    * a king size bed and
    * £3,000 a month in living expenses."

She gave me a big smile, nodded her head and said, 
 
"Sex sex sex, wan free sex for tonight".
 
I replied, "Wow, you Thai women are really hospitable!"
 
A guy standing next to me overheard, tapped me on the shoulder and said, 
 

"What she really said was:  666136429."

15/04/17, 10:27 AM - Lola Infosys: It is an exceptionally hot summer. Time for a beer. I went to the local alcohol shop.

“Give me two bottles of chilled beer please” I said to the shopkeeper.

“Sorry sir. Dry Day. Birthday of River Ganges”.

Yes. Rivers have birthdays now. I went back the next day. “Can I have the beer now?”

He handed me two bottles. I was on my way back home. The police stopped me looking awfully serious.

“Sir. We have received intelligence that you have alcohol in your car” the police inspector said.

“Yes. But I did not consume any before I started to drive”.

“That does not matter. You are now holding a bottle within 5 km of the river Narmada. Get out of your car”.

I got out. Another constable came and murmured something into the inspector’s ears.

“Sorry sir. You can go”.

I was surprised and asked him why.

“We have just been informed that due to scanty rainfall, the river boundary has shifted around 5 meters. You are in the safe zone”.

“Phew. Thanks sir. I will go straight home and drink only there”.

“OK. Please don’t drive by MG Road. We have another check-post there. That is within 500 meters of a school. Don’t take Rajiv Chowk either. That is within 200 meters of a place of worship. You can get caught”.

“OK. So what should I do now?”

“Take SV Road for now. Also go home and download the beta version of the ‘Google Maps’ app. They now have ‘Tipple routes’. Red for traffic jam, Blue for smooth, Yellow for slow moving and Brown for the No Alcohol ‘Dry’ zone. These are now updated on a real time basis”.

I reached home and opened my bottle. Suddenly the bell rang. It was the police again.

“Now what?”

“Sir. We have received intelligence that you have alcohol in your house”.

“Yes. But I am not within 500 meters of anything and the Ganges, Narmada, Kaveri, Indus, even the bloody Mithi River is more than 5 km away”.

“Sir. Rules are rules. We have to check if you are old enough.”

I showed him my PAN card.

“Sorry sir. This won’t work. There are too many fake IDs out there. Did you know there were 4 lakh fake students in schools in UP. Please place your hand on this machine so that we can authenticate. It is all biometric now”.

I placed my right thumb on the sensor. A red light started to flash.

“Sorry sir. We will have to confiscate your beer!”

“Now what? I have complied with all the rules” I protested.

“Sir. Fresh rule was formed yesterday. Mars is in the fifth house of your Almanac. We cannot sell alcohol to anyone whose Mars is weighing on his Rahu in the fourth house”.

“How the hell do you know that?”

“Sir UID. Your ‘kundli’ is now linked to your Aadhaar card”.

26/04/17, 8:31 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: *20 popular words used in Bangalore and their meaning*

Today, let us know some popular words used in Bangalore which we think has no replacement in the English Vocabulary.

*Pataaysu*

A popularly used word in Bangalore which means to make a girl fall in love. There is also a word in Hindi called ‘Pataana’ which has the same meaning.

*Dabba*

The word Dabba is an emotion to Bangaloreans because this is used in almost all the situations. Literally, the word Dabba means a box or a container but in a slang tone, it means useless or worthless.

*Pantar*

It is used as a synonym for expert, leader or a big man.

*Punda*

Punda is a word which is highly used by media to describe the thief or dacoits. It is used as a synonym for loafer or rogue. Sometimes, it is also used for a person who is mischevious and naughty.

*Kaage*

The literal kannada meaning of the word Kaage is Crow but it used as a slang word in Bangalore. It means to fool or prank someone.

*Gandhi Class*

Sarcastically the word Gandhi Class is used for a person who is silent and do not involve in activities like smoking, boozing and eating non-veg etc. It is also used for a person who is girlish in nature.

*Hoge*

Hoge is a typical Bangalore word used as a synonym for screwed up, dead or the end. For an instance, you plan for a Goa trip and it doesn’t happen then you say it as ‘goa trip Hoge’.

*Kirik*

Kirik is an authentic slang word of Bangalore which is used for a person who always causes problems. It can both be positive and negative and it goes with the situation. You can relate this to the title of popular Kannada movie ‘Kirik Party’.

*Figure*

If you have not used this world then you are not a true Bangalorean. Figure or Figar is a slang word used for a pretty girl. This can be related to a hindi word ‘Maal’ and a Hyderabadi word ‘Potti’.

*Maama*

A literal meaning of the word Maama is an uncle but in Bangalore, it is used for the policemen. The reason is unknown but Bangaloreans never say a policeman a policeman. They use the word Maama. Any policemen reading this by the way?

*Gubaal*

Gubaal is an another Desi Kannada word used in Bangalore for a person who is a loser or a dumb ass. It is a popular slang word used in the city.
 

*Bekitha*

Bekitha means ‘was it required?’ Suppose you mess up too badly and regret. If your friends say ‘Bekitha?’ then without a doubt, you are living in Bangalore.

*Udees*

Udees is a Bangalorean synonym for finish, spoil or damage. The word has become more popular through kannada movies and it is an authentic Bangalore slang word.

*Vaanchu*

Vaanchu is an another Bangalorean synonym for words like beat and punch. If I have to put that in a local accent then “ Virat Kohli Malinga ge sariyagi vaanchda guru” and this translates to “Virat Kohli has brutally hit Malinga Bro.”

*OSI*

Oosi means ‘free of cost’. A perfect example would be ‘Jio is offering Osi Internet these days.’

*Kalchko*

The word Kalchko translates to ‘get lost’ or ‘leave the place’. It has a sarcastic tone and again a popular slang word of Bangalore.

*Dove*

It is not a soap brand or a bird in any meaning. If you hear Dove in Bangalore then it only means to a girlfriend. “ What is your weekend plan? Going out for a movie with your Dove?”

*Ooshtu* (susthu)

Ooshtu means exhaust or energy drain. This is a slang word which is used to express the feeling of getting drained up.

*Gaanchali*

I guess you all might have heard this word. It is used both as a verb and adjective for a person who shows an unnecessary attitude.

There are so many other words like *Guru, Sishya, Maccha, Bombat, Chitranna, Sade, Shaa, Maga* etc......

27/04/17, 7:50 PM - Vishak: Bahubali part 2 story:

* Anushka is daughter of kattappa who is a loyal servant to Mahishmathi kingdom.

* Both Raana and Prabhas fell in love with her.

* But Anushka rejects Raana and feels Prabhas is suitable
person for her.

* Sivagaami who is very strict in ruling Mahishmati kingdom rejects the Love with a low caste girl and also sends a warning to kattappa.

* Kattappa aslo tries to stop his daughters relationship with Baahubali, who would sworn as a King of Mahishmathi, in near future.

* keeping this caste crap aside prabhas will marry Anushka.

* Sivagaami who doesnt like relation with a low caste girl opposes prabhas to sworn as king of Mahishmati and turns in favour of Raana.

* With the poisonous words of nazar and Raana, Shivagaami becomes cruel, and orders Kattappa to kill
Prabhas.

* Kattappa who is a loyal servant to the dynasty obeys the
order and kills Baahubali even though was his Son in law.

* After the death of Baahubali, Raana becomes the king of
mahishmati,

* hearing that Anushka is giving a birth to
Baahubali's child, Nazar and Raana plans to kill the child to clear their way for better and safe future.

* By hearing their plan, shivagami is shocked and opposes to do that for bahubali's infant.

* Nazar and Raana opposes her and tells her to be quite in this matter.

* Knowing their bad plan in killing of Baahubali, prisoning Anushka, and now, of killing Baahubali's son, She feels guilty and decides to save the baby.

* In the process of saving the child, Shivagaami
succeeds even though she loses her life by drowning.

* Kattappa is still serving the king because he is bound to his morale of serving the king, no matter who the king is. 

* All the gorella groups, Aslam khan(KICHA SUDEEP), Kattappa and Shivudu, attack on Ballaladeva and conquers the empire and rescues Anushka.

* This story of "BAHUBALI - The conclusion" is leaked directly from the sets of this movie.

Go enjoy the hard work of Baahubali 2, in 2016. But dont break your head till then, wondering why kattappa killed bahubhali.

JAI MAHISHMATHI...

05/05/17, 8:10 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Referring to Mysuru in Karnataka which topped the ranks in 2016 and 2014 and ranked five in this year’s survey, Shri Naidu asserted that in no way it meant that cleanliness has declined in the city or the city government scaled down its efforts. He explained that Mysuru scored over 87% out of the total score of 2,000 in both 2017 and 2016 indicating that sanitation level has not come down this year while other cities have scored over Mysuru. “This spirit of competition is sought to be promoted through such surveys to help cities know where they stand in absolute terms and in relation to other cities as well” said the Minister.

06/05/17, 11:11 PM - Lola Infosys: Two Pakistanis...
Zardari and Musharraf moved to Paris where they made friends with a French guy named Jean Paul.

They used to go all over Paris with him when suddenly one day...
Jean Paul disappeared.

The two went to the police and lodged a complaint. 

The police asked them if they could give some vital clues about Jean Paul that would help find him. 

Zardari says...
"Jean-Paul was handsome and tall "

Police say...
"Most Frenchmen are like that. Give us something specific " 

Musharraf says...
"Jean Paul had blue eyes and was very fair "

Police say...
"C'mon guys, lots of Frenchmen have blue eyes and fair hair, tell us something specific " 

Zardari and Musharraf...
"Oh yes...now we remember. Jean Paul had two holes in his ass "

The Policemen get really interested. 

"Now that's something very specific, but tell us, how do you know this? 
Have you guys seen it ?"

Zardari and Musharraf...
"No we haven’t actually seen the holes, but wherever we went with Jean Paul, everyone used to say... 
"Here comes Jean Paul with the two assholes "!!!😜😀😂

08/05/17, 9:22 PM - Lola Infosys: After 10 years, the wife starts to think their kid looks kinda strange so she decides to do a DNA test.
She finds out that the kid is actually from completely different parents.

Wife: Honey, I have something very serious to tell you

Husband: What’s up?

Wife: According to DNA test results, this is not our kid

Husband: Well you dont’t remember, do you??
 When we were leaving the hospital, we noticed that our baby had pooped.
 Then you said:
 - Please go change the baby, I’ll wait for you here.
 So I went inside, got a clean one and left the dirty one there 😆😆😆

08/05/17, 9:39 PM - Lola Infosys: College Reunion

He was a widower and she a widow.

They had known each other for a number of years being high school classmates and having attended class reunions in the past without fail.

This 60th anniversary of their class, they had a wonderful evening, their spirits high.The widower throwing admiring glances across the table. The widow smiling coyly back at him.

Finally, he picked up courage to ask her, "Will you marry me?"

After about six seconds of careful consideration, she answered, "Yes,..... yes I will!"

The evening ended on a happy note for the widower. But the next morning he was troubled.

Did she say “Yes” or did she say “No?”

He couldn't remember. Try as he would, he just could not recall. He went over the conversation of the previous evening, but his mind was blank.

He remembered asking the question but for the life of him he could not recall her response. With fear and trepidation he picked up the phone and called her.

First, he explained that he couldn't remember as well as he used to. Then he reviewed the past evening.

As he gained a little more courage he then inquired of her. "When I asked if you would marry me, did you say “Yes” or did you say “No?”

"Why you silly man, I said ‘Yes. Yes I will.’ And I meant it with all my heart."

The widower was delighted. He felt his heart skip a beat.

Then she continued. "And I am so glad you called because I couldn't remember who asked me!”😳😁

12/05/17, 1:19 PM - Lola Infosys: *Beautiful explanation by Swami Vivekananda:*

Explaining the meaning of ‘Association’. He said..

“The rain drop from the sky: if it is caught in hands, it is pure enough for drinking. If it falls in a gutter, its value drops so much that it can’t be used even for washing the feet. If it falls on hot surface, it perishes. If it falls on lotus leaf, it shines like a pearl and finally, if it falls on oyster, it becomes a pearl. The drop is same, but its existence & worth depend on with whom it associates.”
Always be associated with people who are good at heart.
*Sending this to the people with beautiful heart❤*

The Hydrogen Powered Starbus Fuel Cell bus is a zero-emission mass transport solution, for inter-city commute and has been developed in partnership with ISRO . Combining hydrogen gas and oxygen, the fuel cell produces electricity to power the electric motor, with water and heat as a by-product. This is the first time an Indian manufacturer has ventured in this direction.

25/05/17, 5:52 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: *Rujuta Diwekar* is the highest paid *dietician* in India. She is the one who took care of *junior Ambani* to lose 108 kgs. 
*Her advice to diabetics*:

1. *Eat fruits grown locally* ..... Banana, Grapes, Chikoo, Mangoes. All fruits have FRUCTOSE so it doesn't matter that you are eating a mango over an Apple. A Mango comes from Konkan and Apple from Kashmir. So Mango is more local to you. 

*Eat all the above fruits in DIABETES as the FRUCTOSE* will eventually manage your SUGAR

  2. Choose Seed oils than Veggie oils. Like choose ground nut, mustard, coconut & til. *Don't choose chakachak packing oils*, like olive,  rice bran etc 
*Go for kachchi ghani oils than refined oils* 

  3. Rujuta spends max time in her talks talking about GHEE and its benefits.
*Eat GHEE daily*. How much GHEE we should eat depends on food. Few foods need more GHEE then eat more and vice versa. Eat ample *GHEE. It REDUCES cholesterol*.

  4. *Include COCONUT.* Either scraped coconut over food like poha, khandvi or chutney with idli and dosa 
Coconut has *ZERO CHOLESTEROL* and it makes your WAIST SLIM 

  5. *Don't eat oats, cereals for breakfast*. They are packaged food and we don't need them.  Also they are tasteless and boring and our day shouldn't start with boring stuff. 
Breakfast should be poha, upma, idli, dosa, paratha 

  6. Farhaan Akhtar's New ad of biscuits - fibre in every bite... Even ghar ka kachara has fibre, likewise oats have fibre. Don't chose them for fibre. *Instead of oats, eat poha, upma, idli, dosa* 

  7. *No JUICES till you have teeth* in your mouth to chew veggies and fruits

  8. *SUGARCANE is the real DETOX* . Drink the juice fresh or eat the SUGARCANE 

  9. For pcos, thyroid - do strength training and weight training and avoid all packaged food 

10. *RICE - eat regular WHITE RICE. NO NEED of Brown rice.* Brown rice needs 5-6 whistles to cook and when it tires your pressure cooker, then why do you want to tire your tummy. 

A white rice is hand pounded simple rice 

*Rice* is not high is GI INDEX.  Rice has mediun GI index and by eating it with daal / dahi / kadhi we bring its GI index further down 
If we take _ghee over this daal chawal then the GI INDEX is brought further down._
*B.* Rice has some rich minerals and you can eat it even three times a day 

11. How much should we eat - *eat more if you are more hungry,* let your stomach be your guide and vice versa 

12. We can *eat rice and chapati together* or only rice if you wish. It depends on your hunger. *Eat RICE in ALL THREE MEALS without any fear.*

13. Food shouldn't make you scared like eating rice and ghee. *Food should make you FEEL GOOD* 

14. *NEVER* look at *CALORIES*. Look at *NUTRIENTS*

15. *No bread, biscuits, cakes, pizza, pasta* 

16. Ask yourself is this the food my Nani & Dadi ate?  If yes then eat without fear. 

17. Eat as per your season. *Eat pakoda, fafda, jalebi in monsoon*. Your hunger is as per season. Few seasons we need fried food so eat them. 

18. When not to have chai - tea - don't drink tea as the first thing in morning or when you are hungry. Rest you can have it 2-3 times a day and with sugar 

19. *NO GREEN tea please.* No green, yellow, purple, blue tea. 

20. Eat *ALL* of your *TRADITIONAL* foods. 

21. Strictly *NO* to packaged foods / drinks.

22. *Exercise / Walk* 
 to digest & stay healthy.

30/05/17, 5:46 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Worth reading.... We are living in this awesome Bengaluru someone in Marathahalli, someone in Domlur and some other in Basvangudi but have you ever wondered how did these areas got their names? I know that your answer is NO. Let’s know it today. It is interesting.

1.Nagarbhavi

The name literally  means “a well of snakes”. The name is due to the high number of snakes present in the area before it got urbanized. Also, some believe that it is called a “well” because of the surrounding hillocks that are no longer present  due to urbanization.



2.Marathahalli

The area got its name from a fighter aircraft named Marut which was designed and assembled in HAL, which is very close to this area. There are though a few contradicting reports that a Marut once crash landed in this area giving it its name. Halli in Kannada means village.



3.Basavangudi

The name “Basavanagudi” refers to the Bull Temple that is located here. You can find a monolith statue of the Nandi Bull. Basava in Kannada, the local language, means Bull and Gudi means temple. Hence, the name Basavanagudi.



4.Malleswaram/ Malleswara

Located in the north-west of Bangalore, it derives its name from the famous Kaadu Malleshwara temple in this area.



5. BTM layout

BTM is actually an abbreviation for Byrasandra Tavarekere Madiwala. The area for the layout was carved out from these three neighborhoods and hence the name.



6. HSR Layout

HSR is an abbreviation for Hosur Sarjapur Road Layout. A relatively new suburb located in the south-east of Bangalore, the layout, which is built on land reclaimed from the Agara lake, is located between Hosur Road and Sarjapur Road.



7. Rajajinagar

The area was named after Rajagopalachari, the freedom fighter and the last Governor-General of India.



8. Kodigehalli

This place/area was reportedly given as a gift(gift = Koduge in Kannada) by the former King Kempegowda to someone.



9. Madiwala

Madiwala in kannada means a washerman. Years when Bangalore ended in Jayanagar, this area was full of washermen and hence the area got the same name.



10. Sunkadkatte

The area was like a tollgate which was next to Lake and in Kannada Sunka means Tax and Katte mean lake.



11. Seshadripuram

The area was named after the late Diwan of Mysore Seshadri Iyer.



12. Domlur

Mosquitoes are called Domalu in Telugu. Since the area was notorious for its mosquito population, it is named as Domlur [Doma + ooru which translates to Mosquito Village]



13. Doddanekundi

Not that it is the back part of Elephant. The area was again dominated by Telugu origin where it was originally called as Dodda Nakka Vundi which means ‘There’s a big jackal there’ which then became Doddanekundi in the mouth of kannadigas.



14. Ulsoor

The area had a jackfruit orchard. Jackfruit is called Halasu in Kannada. Halasu-ooru (Jackfruit Village) colloquially became Ulsoor.



15. RT Nagar

The area is named after the National anthem writer Rabindranath Tagore

06/06/17, 12:19 PM - Vishak: *IS BEEF EATING ALLOWED FOR HINDUS?*
_____*Forwarded as received *___

A recent photograph of some Hindu Protesters demanding a ban on non-vegetarian food made me sit and take notice on vedaas. I believe that these protesters are ignorant of what their religion preaches.They are simply going against their own religious scriptures.

ANSWERS FROM HINDUS SCRIPTURE.

👉Manusmriti 
chapter 5 verse30

:"It is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals,for God has created both the eaters and the eatables".

👉Aapastanba Grishsutram(1/3/10):
says,"The cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of 'Shraaddha of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage".

👉Rigveda (10/85/13):declares "On the occasion of a girls marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered".

👉Rigveda (6/17/1) : states that, "Indra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo".

👉Vashishta Dharmasutra (11/34):says,If a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ,'Shraaddha' he goes to hell".

👉Hinduisms great propagator Swami Vivekaanand said thus: "You will be surprised to know that according to ancient Hindu rite and rituals, a man cannot be a good Hindu who does not eat beef ".
(The complete works of Swami Vivekanand vol :3/5/36) 

"The book The history and culture of the indian people" published by Bharatiya vidya bhawan,bombay and edited by renowned historian R C Majumdar (vol 2 ,page 18 says)This is said in the mahabharata that "king Ratinder used to kill 2000 other animals in addition to 2000 cows daily in order to give their meat in charity".

Aadi shankaraachaarya commentary on Brahadaranyako panishad 6/4/18 says:'Odaan' rice mixed with meat is called 'maansodan' on being asked whose meat it should be, he answers 'Uksha' is used for an ox, which is capable to produce semen.

👉Dear hindu brothers and sisters what should we follow?????

Religious books or communal political parties??????

07/06/17, 7:11 PM - Ba: Sharing a bit sarcastic message from the Vice Chancellor of Mumbai University.

 One liners about India that are completely true :

 1. If you want to know how divided we are, just look at matrimonial page of our newspaper

 2. India is running the software of tomorrow on the hardware of yesterday

 3. If the mobile gets spoiled blame the child, if child gets spoiled blame the mobile

 4. If someone is asking for dirty cloth to clean something, then you are in India

 5. The only country where people fight to be termed 'backward'.

 6. In India, you don't cast your vote, you vote your caste.

 7. An incredible country where actors are playing cricket, cricketers are playing politics, politicians are watching porn and porn stars are becoming actors.

 8. Sarcasm is like electricity, half of India doesn't get it.

 9. And the ultimate one:

 The country where liking a Facebook post and sending messages on Whats App gets you arrested, while raping does not...

Doctors thought it is something Super Natural and spooky.

Next Sunday, few minutes before 11 AM, all doctors & Nurses stood around that Bed & Waiting to see what it was.😯😶😶😶

14/06/17, 10:35 PM - Lola Infosys: Excerpts:

*All over the world…*

*Stone pelting is bad.*

*Stone pelting with an intent to cause grievous injury is a crime.*

*Stone pelting with an intent to hurt an armed security officer on duty is suicide.*

If you pelt a stone at an *Israeli Soldier* - They will identify you - Kill you - identify your house - respectfully request your family members to vacate - fill your empty house with concrete.

If you pelt a stone at a uniformed and armed *US Marine* on Duty - you won’t even live to say sorry to 3 generations of your family members who’d never know how bad the airline food really is - as they might all get listed on the no-fly list[8]for good.

If you plan to pelt a stone on a Spetsnaz in *Moscow* - hope you have great cooking skills - because just in case you aren’t shot and killed immediately - you might have to spend the rest of your life being ‘useful’ to the lonely and bored soldiers of the Black Dolphin[9]facility on the Kazak border.

And in case you plan to pelt a stone at a guard in the *Tiananmen Square* - hope you take your family into confidence, since it is they who would be suffering the most, while you are made to wait in a 4ftx4ftx4ft cell in one of the Chinese Organ Harvesting facilities, awaiting a patient that matches your blood type.

Your government will not just make a profit by selling your organs - they’ll also make your family pay for the operation and the subsequent funeral - after they freeze the bank accounts of your family members of course.

But we *in India* are a little different.

We are the only country in the world which even has a debate on this subject.

the making of our Metro 😀
15/06/17, 9:31 AM - Lola Infosys: Namma Metro - Metro train for Bengaluru - the North-south line called the '*Green line*' will be inaugurated by president Pranab Mukherjee this Sat, 17-Jun-2017. And, services will be open to public from the next day.
Daily commuter-footfall is expected to touch 5 lakh once the Green line is fully operational. 
Majestic station (underground station) is where Green line and Purple line intersect and is the biggest interchange station in India! The area is the size of six football fields and height (depth) is equivalent to a seven-storey building.

Some pictures: http://themetrorailguy.com/2017/06/14/pics-bangalore-metros-green-line-stations-ready-for-operations/

He pours from the bottle onto the teaspoon and offers it to the pharmacist.

"Could you taste this for me, please?"

The pharmacist takes the teaspoon, puts it in his mouth, swills the liquid around and swallows it.

"Does that taste sweet to you?" asks the chap.

"No, not at all," says the chemist.

"Oh that's a relief," says Paddy. "The doctor told me to come here and get my urine tested for sugar by the pharmacist."

24/06/17, 8:55 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Corporate hospitals are paying a salary of *1½ lakh* per month to their doctors.

But they have monthly targets.
the target condition for them to remain in job is that, *they have to write tests & scans worth *3 lakhs* & *trap 25 patients* for surgery every month.

This is not happening in *Charity Hospitals.*

In many hospitals, unwanted surgeries & risky premature cataract surgeries are being carried out. One has to be fearful of corporate hospitals.

Never show your medical Insurance card or say *"Doctor, don't bother about expense, please save Me"*

*If they terrify u & do not give time to think then, You must be alert & come out and not join there*

If they advise a surgery or a medical procedure,then. Take time & call at *70266 46022* or send ur medical reports at *medical@medisense.meor* else visit at *medisensehealth.com* They will get u a 2nd opinion from an expert doctors panel. It is a free service for patients.

This free service for patients is available in *21 cities in India* which includes *Udupi, Mangalore, Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyd* etc.

*Please pass on to all u r loved ones.*

I just now did!🙋‍♂

Ethical hacking is big business these days, as the corporations try to protect themselves from cyber-attacks. You can get the skills you need for just $49.

15/07/17, 10:27 AM - Lola Infosys: Once a Bright and Intelligent young man went for an IAS  interview.

He was asked -

Q 1. When did India get Independence?

He answered - The efforts started long back; but could succeed in 1947.

Q 2. Who were the persons, who played important role in this fight for Independence?

Answer - There are many people, who were involved and contributed in this. If I give a name, it will be injustice to others.

Q 3. Do you think, Corruption is the greatest enemy of the country?

Answer - A committee is investigating in this matter. I can give a correct reply to this only after seeing the report.

The Interview Board was impressed by his original ideas. They asked him to wait outside; but also advised him not to reveal the questions, as they may ask the same questions to other candidates also.

When the young man went out of the room, Sardar inquired about the questions asked. The young man said that he had promised the interview board not to disclose the questions.

But, Sardar found a way out. "Tell me the answer you gave."

The young man, thought it to be okay, as he was not going back on his words of "not disclosing the QUESTIONS". So he gave him the three answer which Sardar quickly learnt by heart.

When Sardar went in for interview, this is what happened.

Q 1. When were you born?

Sardar:- The efforts started long back, but could succeed in 1947.

Interviewers got confused...they asked next question.

Q 2. What is your father's name?

Sardar :- There are many people, who were involved and contributed in this. If I give a name, it will be injustice to others.

The board members were shocked at the reply..they said.

Q 3. Are you mad?

Sardar :- A committee is investigating in this matter. I can give a correct reply to this only after seeing the report.

In our life, problems may go from *Haywards 2000* to *Haywards 5000,* but we must take them as a *Royal Challenge*  otherwise people will call us *Old Monk* and put a *Black Label* on our name. So we must learn from *Teachers* to fight like *Jack Daniel,* live like a *Bagpiper,* walk like *Johny Walker,* work till *8 PM* & think like *Director Special.* Catch the ideas like *Kingfisher* and *Knockout* all the problems. Then life will be *Imperial* & we will become *Aristocrat* & there will be value for our *Signature*🍻

Cheers!✨✨✨✨✨✨🍻

22/07/17, 6:48 PM - Theja 2: Big Joke
When unlimited calls and data are available only in Rs. 399/-

Then why members of Parliament are getting Rs. 15000/- as telephone allowance ?

245 Members of Rajya Sabha
545 Members of Lok Sabha
790 members of parliament multiplied by Rs 15000/- thats 
Rs.11,850,000/- Only wastage of our tax money.
Think and make this post viral till it reaches our PM who is advising citizens to 
surrender LPG subsidy.
🤔🤔🤔.

And Love I laugh to scorn; 
And lust of fame was but a dream 
That vanish’d with the morn; 
And if I pray, the only prayer 
That moves my lips for me 
Is, “Leave the heart that now I bear, 
And give me liberty!” 
Yes, as my swift days near their goal, 
’Tis all that I implore: 
In life and death a chainless soul,
With courage to endure.

At the Wall of Kindness, one can leave gently used clothes, shoes, books, blankets, toys & more, which in turn can be picked up by the people in need of them. You can find this symbol of camaraderie adjacent to the Sri Ganesh HPCL Petrol Pump at Dasappa Circle, JLB Road, #Mysuru.

18/08/17, 10:58 AM - Theja: RESIGNATION EMAIL RECEIVED FROM THE VISHAL SIKKA, MD AND CEO BY THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS ON August 18, 2017.
Dear Board Colleagues,
Over the last few days, since our earlier call, I've met Sesh several times, talked to you individually
at length, and spent time thinking things thru with Vandana. During this time, one of our
employees, Sandeep Karamongikar, died in his sleep, likely of a massive heart attack. He was
working on the chatbot frontend in Nia. Also over the weekend, in possibly the greatest
demonstration of AI capability ever, a bot built by the researchers at OpenAI (yes, that OpenAI),
defeated the world's best players of DOTA2, a multiplayer online video game, a game where the
bot learned to play entirely from scratch. Further demonstrating that the force to automate
routine, even advanced, activities is an unstoppable and exponential one. And the Charlottesville
incident here in the US demonstrated once again the power of words and silences to cause real
damage, or to heal.
After much reflection, I have concluded that it is indeed time for me to leave my current positions
as MD and CEO, and I have communicated my resignation to Sesh.
I will be working closely with Sesh, Ravi, Pravin, with all of you, and the senior management team
to plan out the details and the timelines to ensure a smooth transition and in the meantime,
continue our work without disruption, and ensuring that we protect our company, the
employees, the clients, and the interests of every shareholder. You can count on my commitment
to this.
I came here to help navigate the company through what I saw as a massive transformation
opportunity, to transform our company and restore strong profitable growth, as well as help 
transform the business of our customers. I came to do this with the power of technology, given
my experiences with similar transformations, my background in AI, and the structural changes
that I saw happening in the IT services industry. This needed new skills, new thinking, new
initiatives, and a transformation in the culture, from a cost-oriented value delivery, to
entrepreneurship oriented value delivery. You have heard me articulate this many times before.
This type of a transformation has always been a passion for me, indeed I took this job for this
reason. We have achieved much in the last 3+ years, and for sure we can all be proud of the
powerful seeds of transformation that have already been sowed. No one anticipated the
additional headwinds like the geo-political disruptions (Brexit, Trump, visa etc.) that made this
transformation even more challenging, but also rewarding. But, the distractions that we have
seen, the constant drumbeat of the same issues over and over again, while ignoring and
undermining the good work that has been done, take the excitement and passion out of this
amazing journey. Over the last many months and quarters, we have all been besieged by false,
baseless, malicious and increasingly personal attacks. Allegations that have been repeatedly
proven false and baseless by multiple, independent investigations. But despite this, the attacks
continue, and worse still, amplified by the very people from whom we all expected the most
steadfast support in this great transformation. This continuous drumbeat of distractions and
negativity over the last several months/quarters, inhibits our ability to make positive change and
stay focused on value creation. Addressing the noise by itself is damaging; hundreds of hours of
my own time has gone into this recently. But the structural challenges this engenders within the
organization, has a very damaging effect on our ability to carry out any kind of a transformation,
especially one that is as fundamental as transforming from a cost-oriented to an innovationoriented
value delivery to clients.
Therefore, I have come to this moment and the end of this journey. I hope that it gives everyone
a chance to reflect, and give the transformation effort another big push and move the company
forward rapidly to build its future, to build upon the foundation that we have laid over these past
3 years. If these types of attacks continue, I hope each of you will continue to be the voice of
fairness and reason - providing the active, emphatic and unequivocal support that the company, 
the management, the employees, and all of the stakeholders and friends of the company need

20/08/17, 3:05 PM - Lola Infosys: Modi walked into a bar around 9:58 pm. He sat down next to Rahul at the bar and stared up at the TV.

The 10 pm news was coming on. The news crew was covering the story of a man on the ledge of a large building preparing to jump.

Rahul looked at Modi and said, "Do you think he will jump ?"

Modi said, "You know, I bet he will jump."

Rahul replied, "Well, I bet he won't."

Modi placed Rs. 1000 on the bar and said, "You're on !"

Just as Rahul placed his money on the bar, the guy on the ledge jumped off the building, falling to his death.

Rahul was very upset, but willingly handed his Rs.1000 to Modi,  saying, "Fair is fair. Here's your money."

Modi replied, "I can't take your money. I saw this earlier on the 5 pm news, and so I knew he would jump."

Rahul replied, "I did too, but didn't think he would do it again."

This time Modi took the money.

.
Gujju puts a board "Ghee @300/kg" 
Big store reduces the rate to 280/kg
Gujju " Ghee @260/kg" 
Big store " 240/kg" 
.
A curious person who was observing this price competition, advises the Gujju, 'brother you can't compete with a big store for a long' and stop this price competition for the Ghee!

She looks quite frightened and the man she is with is a fat, old, redhead slob who looks like a lecher, very sullen, mean and dangerous.
We must save the lady!"

23/08/17, 1:14 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Story - Sex for $ 20 😉
    
Believe it or not, it's a true story..

On their wedding night, the young bride approached her new husband and asked for $20.00 for their first lovemaking encounter.

In his highly aroused state, her husband readily agreed.

This scenario was repeated each time they made love, for more than 30 years, with him thinking that it was a cute way for her to afford new clothes and other incidentals that she needed.

Arriving home around noon one day, she was surprised to find her husband in a very drunken state.

During the next few minutes, he explained that his employer was going through a process of corporate downsizing, and he had been let go.

It was unlikely that at the age of 59, he'd be able to find another job.

Calmly, his wife handed him a bank book which showed more than thirty years of steady deposits and interest totaling nearly $1 million.

Then she showed him certificates of deposits issued by the bank which were worth over $2 million.

She explained that she had 'charged' him for sex, and these were the results of her savings and investments.

The husband was so astounded he could barely speak.

Finally he found his voice and blurted out, 'If I'd had any idea what you were doing, I would have had sex only with you.'

That's when she shot him..🔫
 
You know, men just don't know when to keep their mouth shut, specially when drunk..!😜💣🔫🔪
 Keep 😶😶😶

Its the husband's funeral tommorrow.

27/09/17, 4:31 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: George went to the doctor's office to ask for a double dose of Viagra.

The doctor told him that he couldn't allow him a double dose.

"Why not?' asked 

"Because it's not safe,' replied the doctor

"But I need it really bad,' said George 

"Well, why do you need it so badly?' asked the doctor.

George answered,
 "My girlfriend is coming into town on Friday; 
my ex-wife will be here on Saturday; 
and my wife is coming home on Sunday. 

Can't you see? I must have a double dose."

The doctor finally relented saying, "Okay, I'll give it to you, but you have to come in on Monday morning so that I can check you to see if there are any bad side effects."

On Monday, George dragged himself in to the doctor's office, his right arm in a sling.

The doctor asked, "What happened to you?

George said, "No one showed up."😂😁👍

He replied, 'I'd give food and houses to all the homeless people.' His parents beamed with pride.
'Wow...what a worthy goal.' I told him. 'But you don't have to wait until you're Prime Minister to do that. You can come over to my house and mow the lawn, pull weeds, and sweep my yard, and I'll pay you Rs.500. Then I'll take you over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out, and you can give him the same 500 rupee note for food and new set of clothes .'
He thought that over for a few seconds, then he looked me straight in the eyes and asked, ' Why doesn't the homeless guy come over and do the work, and you can just pay him Rs.500?'
I said, 'Welcome to the Rightist fold.'
His parents still aren't speaking to me...

29/09/17, 8:53 AM - Lola Infosys: Where n when
29/09/17, 8:55 AM - Lola Infosys: Good read:

● At 20 years "foreign country" and "hometown" is the same. (No matter where you are, you can always adapt) 

● At 30 years, "night time" and "daytime" is the same. (A few days of no sleep, does not matter) 

● At 40 years, "highly educated" and  "lowly educated" is the same. (Lowly educated persons, may even earn more money) 

● At 50 years, "beauty" and "ugly" is the same. (No matter how pretty you are, at this age, wrinkles, dark spots, etc. start to appear.) 

● At 60 years, "high official" and "low official" are the same. (After retirement, their status are the same)

● At 70 years, "big house" and "small house" is the same. (Joints degeneration,  cannot walk, only require a little space .)

● At 80 years, "have money" and "no money" is the same. (Even when you spend money, you won't be able to spend much) 

● At 90 years old, being "man" and "woman" is the same. 

● At 100 years, "Sleeping" and "waking up" is the same. (After you wake up, you still don't know what to do) 

Take life easy, there are no mysteries to be solved. 
In the long run, we'll all be the same 🙏🙏

30/09/17, 8:28 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I loved the concept:
There are four yugas widely accepted in Hinduism. They are :
1. Satya yug
2. Treta yug (Ramayana)
3. Dwapara yug(Mahabharata)
4. Kal yug(Present)

In Satya yug, the fight was between two worlds (Devalok & Asuralok). Asuralok being the evil, was a different WORLD.

In Treta yug, the fight was between Rama and Ravana. Both rulers from two different COUNTRIES.

In Dwapara yug, the fight was between Pandavas and Kauravas. Both good and evil from the SAME FAMILY.

Kindly note how the evil is getting closer. For example, from a DIFFERENT WORLD to a DIFFERENT COUNTRY to the SAME FAMILY.

Now, know where is the evil in Kaliyug???

It is inside us. Both GOOD AND EVIL LIVE WITHIN. The battle is within us. Who will we give victory to, our inner goodness or the evil within??

Think, identify and fight. 👍Happy Navaratri 🙏

It was understandable, the anger Raavan was going through ...
Looking at the crowd, who was about to burn him, he angrily asked ...
"Did I kidnap any of your wives..??? You idiots..!!!”.
A voice from the crowd said...
"No, You didn't ... !!! That is why we are burning you ... !!!”

09/10/17, 8:15 AM - Nagendra: Good calculation.
On a bank deposit of Rs. 2000/- for one year, what you get is Rs. 160/- @ 8% interest.

On a bank loan of Rs. 2000/- for one year, what you pay is Rs. 260/- @ 13% interest.

But when you eat food for same Rs. 2000/- you pay Rs. 360/- @ 18% to Government!!!
09/10/17, 8:54 AM - Vishak: Still bhakts are blind😆
09/10/17, 8:55 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Panda still wants India to be ruled by Dumbs like Gandhi family.🤦🏼‍♂
09/10/17, 8:56 AM - Vishak: No way but this government I'd also no better
09/10/17, 8:57 AM - Vishak: Dude tax is something everyone has to pay
09/10/17, 8:57 AM - Vishak: Did u c the report of demonitisation
09/10/17, 8:57 AM - Vishak: It's an epic failure
09/10/17, 8:58 AM - Vishak: Same with GST
09/10/17, 8:58 AM - Vishak: Both were good ideas but implementation is worse
09/10/17, 9:01 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Implementation is because lot of people don't want to lose their black money, 
Central government printed billions of 2k notes before the demonistisation but it never reached people, and it's because the corrupt
09/10/17, 9:01 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Its not an epic failure, lot of people secured,
09/10/17, 9:01 AM - Vishak: Dude according RBI is failure
09/10/17, 9:01 AM - Vishak: U can assume anything
09/10/17, 9:02 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lol, tell me how u were bringing the change ? In the vast country
09/10/17, 9:04 AM - Nagendra: Kill everyone.. let there be new civilization
09/10/17, 9:06 AM - Vishak: U bring change not by doing it in one shot
09/10/17, 9:07 AM - Vishak: For example u don't Know to clean ur room
09/10/17, 9:07 AM - Vishak: If ur parents tell clean the entire home in 1 day it would be easy
09/10/17, 9:08 AM - Vishak: Or tell clean ur room first in 2 hours then take break . Next u clean other 2 more rooms, next day complete entire home
09/10/17, 9:08 AM - Vishak: There will be learning
09/10/17, 9:09 AM - Vishak: One by one
09/10/17, 9:09 AM - Nagendra: Throw everything out of room.. bring in things which r needed n place it properly
09/10/17, 9:09 AM - Vishak: 😑
09/10/17, 9:13 AM - Lola Infosys: 😂
09/10/17, 9:14 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Panda, u r way is like before the surgical strike on Pakistan, let's inform all the terrorists to hideaway
09/10/17, 9:14 AM - Lola Infosys: Demo was done by Congress also earlier. They also failed. So point in relating this only to modi rule. Every rule has failures due to corruption
09/10/17, 9:14 AM - Lola Infosys: No point*
09/10/17, 9:15 AM - Vishak: Fully different issue
09/10/17, 9:15 AM - Lola Infosys: Earlier also tax was high. Ppl are saying like gst is the only time tax is high
09/10/17, 9:16 AM - Vishak: Wat high man chosen

09/10/17, 9:17 AM - Lola Infosys: For our ancestors 10% was high. Can't compare old to New
09/10/17, 9:17 AM - Vishak: I don't want to give so much money for government
09/10/17, 9:17 AM - Vishak: End of the day they don't give back anything
09/10/17, 9:17 AM - Lola Infosys: I agree it's not great now. But saying only modi is failure is wrong
09/10/17, 9:18 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: During Indira Gandhi rule, tax was 80% search in Google dumb
09/10/17, 9:18 AM - Lola Infosys: 50yrs of corruption can't be made proper in 5yrs
09/10/17, 9:18 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: U were giving more earlier, just match some old bill to new GST
09/10/17, 9:19 AM - Vishak: Dono y ppl blindly support
09/10/17, 9:19 AM - Vishak: Dude it's different India tat time
09/10/17, 9:19 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Yeah I'm thinking the same, don't why people blindly believe congress
09/10/17, 9:19 AM - Vishak: I mean I not saying Congress was good

09/10/17, 9:20 AM - Lola Infosys: Now also it's different. Don't compare to earlier times
09/10/17, 9:20 AM - Vishak: Dude demonitisation was unnecessary
09/10/17, 9:21 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: UPA fucked us 50 years, some guy bringing change now and no one supports, 
All Indians wants PM like ManMohan
09/10/17, 9:21 AM - Vishak: GST not implemented properly
09/10/17, 9:21 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lo, how will you forcibly take black money then
09/10/17, 9:22 AM - Vishak: Dude I dono everyone is like Congress vs bjp
09/10/17, 9:22 AM - Lola Infosys: It was done by Congress first. Why don't you start complaining that first and then come to Modi's demonization later
09/10/17, 9:22 AM - Vishak: Dude when?
09/10/17, 9:22 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Everything is planned and Implemented, it's not talking off properly its because of the corrupts

09/10/17, 9:24 AM - Vishak: I dono how u bhakts always support him
09/10/17, 9:24 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I don't know why you don't see any change
09/10/17, 9:25 AM - Lola Infosys: Every change has good n bad things, n failures due to ppl not accepting change or due to corruption. But if it was brought keeping in mind for good things, then support it. These big changes can't be completed in 5yrs
09/10/17, 9:25 AM - Vishak: I see fucked up change
09/10/17, 9:25 AM - Lola Infosys: Not supporting only coz it's modi. Even if Kejriwal or raga came up with this, all would have said negatives

CNN
Reasons for lower GDP Growth during the past quarter:

Imagine that you are appointed a Principal/Director of a college which is notorious for cheating and poor quality of education.

You find that most students cheat during the examination with the support of the teachers and do quite well in exams. The result of the college has been always more than 90% in recent years.

You are a person with principles and hence you decide to totally eliminate cheating from the examination. You install CCTV cameras in all examination halls and take actions against the students and the teachers who are found engaged in cheating.

The result is that cheating is totally stopped in examinations.

However, the performance of your college dips drastically and less than 50% students pass. This has been a bad performance in recent times.

You now face flak from all sides.

Students are angry because they failed due to your strictness.

Teachers are angry because their track record got spoiled because of you.

Trustees of college are angry because the result of their college has taken a beating under your charge.

This is what is happening in India right now.
But someone had to cleanup the mess!!

21/10/17, 5:58 AM - Nagendra: Betta anyone? In next 30 mins
21/10/17, 7:51 AM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Don’t be Apologetic about Diwali - Enjoy it 

In my city of Bengaluru alone - 4 lakhs Animals are Killed on Eid which includes 10000 Large animals like Cattle and Camels 
It generates 300 tonnes of animal waste which is just buried in pits near Kogilu on the city outskirts 
For 14 lakh Muslims in Bengaluru - 4 lakh Animals killed 
Even if one Animal weighs 10 kg then can an average person eat 3 kg meat on single day ?
And mind you this includes kids and infants also 
So most of the meat goes waste though people might claim we give it to poor 

If you conflate this number to whole of India then imagine the number of Animals killed on the single day ?
For 200 millon it must be at least 20 millon Animals 
And 200 millon kgs of Meat and staggering 8 billon kgs of Green House gases or Carbon dioxide and we are not even calculating the lakhs of tonnes of bio waste generated  

And now conflate this number to the whole world 
It is 200 millon Animals 80 billon kgs of CO2 

Now let us come to ThanksGiving in USA - 45 million Turkeys are killed 

Christmas in US - 25 million Turkeys are killed 

In US 30 million trees are chopped off every year to make Christmas Tree 
Which is huge pollution 
And 50 million artificial trees are used which is made of plastic and is even more polluting 
On Independence Day July 4th USA uses 1 billion Worth of fire crackers which is 5 times more than what India uses in an whole year 
Chinese use more times more firecrackers on Chinese New Year alone that what US does on July 4
World wide on New year billions Worth Fire crackers are used 
Hindu festivals are the only Eco Friendly festivals on Earth 
As most of Hindus eat only Vegetarian food on festivals 
Other wise every other religion the meat is the most important item on a festival or any celebration 

But when it comes to narrative it is only hindu festivals which are being maligned as polluting 
Holi - Water Pollution so Waterless Holi
Ganesh - Sea or River Pollution So Green Ganesh 
Dussehra - Riots/ sexual abuse so don’t go dandia or no Durga Idol immersion 
Diwali - Air Pollution so no fire crackers 
Have you seen any one raising topic of Pollution on Christmas New year or Eid ?
Has anyone campaigned for Veg Xmas or Green New Year or No killing on Eid ?
So don’t let breaking India forces take the fun out of Diwali 
Let the festivals of lights 
Hindu festivals are green by nature as Hindus worship nature and all tHe festivals are born out of nature worship
PS - The most comprehensive report on Delhi Pollution by IIT Kharagpur has not included Fire crackers in the report 
Road Dust, Concrete batching, Vehicles, Coal tandoors, Crop burning, industries are responsible for Delhi air pollution

28/10/17, 10:30 PM - Lola Infosys: Do you fart in bed ?
This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years, the only friction in their marriage was the husband’s habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke the noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.
Every morning
she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, “Honey you were right… all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.” “What do you mean?” asked his wife. “Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened, but by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers. I think I got most of them back in……......

30/10/17, 5:19 PM - Anni jss: Making a baby. This is hilarious!!!

There is not one dirty word in it, and it is funny!-- 

The Saxenas were unable to conceive children and decided to use a surrogate father to start their family. On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Saxena kissed his wife goodbye and said,!

'Well, I'm off now. The man should be here soon.' 

Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.

'Good morning, Ma'am', he said, 'I've come to...' 

'Oh, no need to explain,' Mrs. Saxena cut in, embarrassed, 'I've been expecting you.' 

'Have you really?' said the photographer. 'Well, that's good. Did you know babies are my speciality?' 

'Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat !'

After a moment she asked, blushing, 'Well, where do we start?' 

'Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there.' 

'Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work out for Harish and me!' 

'Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.' 

'My God, that's a lot!', gasped Mrs. Saxena. 

'Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be In and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.' 

'Don't I know it,' said Mrs. Saxena quietly. 

The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. 'This was done on the top of a bus,' he said. 

'Oh, my Gosh!' Mrs. Saxena exclaimed, grasping at her throat. 

'And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with.' 

'She was difficult?' asked Mrs. Saxena. 

'Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look' 

'Four and five deep?' said Mrs. Saxena, her eyes wide with amazement. 

'Yes', the photographer replied. 'And! for more than three hours, too.”

“The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in.' 

Mrs. Saxena leaned forward. 'Do you mean they actually chewed on your, uh...equipment?' 

'It's true, Ma'am, yes.. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.' 

'Tripod?' 

'Oh yes, Ma'am. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's too big to be held in the hand very long.' 

Mrs. Saxena fainted ! ! !

03/11/17, 9:01 AM - Lola Infosys: After Donald Trump, the world is wondering if it is the blonde men, not women, who are actually a bit dumber. They collected these true stories of blonde men 

---------------------

A blonde man is in the bathroom and his wife shouts: "Did you find the shampoo?"

He answers, "Yes, but I'm not sure what to do... it's for dry hair, and I've already wet mine."

-----------------------

A blonde man sees a letter lying on his doormat. It says on the envelope "DO NOT BEND."

He spends the next 2 hours trying to figure out how to pick it up.

----------------------

A blonde man shouts frantically into the phone, "My wife is pregnant and her contractions are only two minutes apart!"

"Is this her First Child?" asks the Doctor.

"No!" he shouts, "this is her husband!"

-----------------------

A blonde man is in jail, the guard looks in his cell and sees him hanging by his feet.

"Just WHAT are you doing?" he asks.

"Hanging myself," the blonde replies.

"The rope should be around your neck," says the guard.

"I tried that," he replies, "but then I couldn't breathe."

----------------------

An Italian tourist asks a blonde man: "Why do scuba divers always fall backwards off their boats?"

To which the blonde man replies: "Dude, If they fell forward, they'd still be in the boat."

---------------------

A friend told the blonde man: "Christmas is on a Friday this year."

The blonde man then said, "Let's hope it's not the 13th."

---------------------

Two blonde men find three grenades, and they decide to take them to a police station.

One asked: "What if one explodes before we get there?"

The other says: "We'll lie and say we only found two."

---------------------

A woman phoned her blonde neighbor man and said: "Close your curtains the next time you and your wife are intimate. The whole street was watching and laughing at YOU yesterday."

To which the blonde man replied: "Well the joke's on ALL OF YOU because I wasn't even at home yesterday !"

07/11/17, 11:54 PM - Anni jss: *Have you ever read these Western philosophers*
----------------------------------------------

1. *Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910)*

"Hindus and Hindutva will one day rule the world, because this is a combination of knowledge and wisdom".

2. *Herbert Wells (1846 - 1946):*

"Until the effectiveness of Hindutva is restored, how many generations will suffer atrocities and life will be cut off, then one day the entire world will be attracted to it, on that day there will be Dilshad and on that day the world will be inhabited.

3. *Albert Einstein (1879-1955):*

"I understand that through his intelligence and awareness he did that which the Jews could not do. In Hinduism it is the power that can lead to peace."

4. *Huston Smith (1919):*

"The faith which is upon us and this is better than us in the world, then it is Hindutva. If we open our hearts and minds for it, then it will be good for us".

5. *Michael Nostradamus (1503 - 1566):*

"Hindutva will become the ruler religion in Europe, but the famous city of Europe will become the Hindu capital".

6. *Bertrand Russell (1872 - 1970):*

"I read Hinduism and realized that it is for the religion of all the world and all mankind." Hindutva will spread throughout Europe and in Europe, big thinkers of Hinduism will emerge. One day it will come that Hindus will be the real stimulus of the world. ".

7. *Gosta Lobon (1841 - 1931):*

"Hindus speak of peace and reconciliation. I invite Christians to appreciate the faith of reform."

8. *Bernard Shaw (1856 - 1950):*

"The entire world will accept Hindu religion one day and if it can not even accept the real name it will accept it by name only." West will accept Hindutva one day and Hindu will be the religion of those who have studied in the world ".

9. *Johann Geith (1749 - 1832):*

"We all have to accept Hinduism now or later and this is the real religion. If I say no to Hindu, I will not feel bad, I accept this right thing."

*Plz share to all ur links*

09/11/17, 8:56 AM - Vishak: A couple went to a Sex Therapist office at a BIG Corporate Hospital.

The doctor asked,"What can I do for you?"

The man said ,"something is not right., Will you watch us having sex, for your expert analysis?"

The doctor looked puzzled, 🙄 but agreed.

When the couple finished, the doctor said,"There's nothing wrong with the way you have intercourse,"and charged them Rs.1300.

This happened several weeks in a row. The couple would make an appointment, have intercourse with no problems, pay the doctor and then leave.

Finally one day the doctor asked,"exactly what are you trying to find out? You are paying me so much.."


The man said, ."We're not trying to find out anything. She's married and we can't go to her house, I'm married and we can't go to my house." 

The Oberoi charges Rs. 15000,

Taj charges Rs.14000 ,

Le Meridian charges Rs.12500.

We do it here for Rs.1300,

Punch line is yet to come..........

One day, A taxi passenger touched driver on his shoulder to ask something. Driver screamed, lost control of car, went up on footpath & stopped few inches from a shop. Passenger apologised & said: "I didn't realise that a little touch would scare u so much" Driver replied: Sorry it's not ur fault, it's my 1st day as a cab driver, I've been driving a van carrying dead bodies from last 25 years.😜😂

Use Headphone/Earphone and enjoy..

22/11/17, 1:05 PM - Lola Infosys: An Indian goes to Australia and goes to Woolworths (The largest supermarket store in Australia).
He finds cat food at special prices. He picks a dozen cans of cat food and goes to
check out.

The Manager gets suspicious. He thinks that this guy cannot have a cat and will
probably feed cat food to his kids. He asks the Indian to show him his cat before he
could let him have cat food. The Indian goes home and returns with a cat and gets
to buy the cat food.

One week later the Indian finds dog food at special prices. He picks a dozen cans of
dog food and goes to check out.

The Manager again gets suspicious. He thinks that this guy has a cat but he cannot
have a dog and he will probably feed dog food to his kids. He asks the Indian to bring
and show him the dog before he can let him have dog food.

The Indian goes home and returns with a dog. He gets to buy the dog food.

The following week later the Indian comes to Woolworths with a bag. He asks the
manager to put his hand in the bag.

The Manager puts his hand in the bag, feels some thing slimy and immediately takes it
out.

He shouted at the Indian, "What the F*** is this? Is this shit, you Idiot?"

The Indian calmly replies, "Yes, and I want to buy toilet paper.."

A Nigerian mother was lucky enough to see her 3 daughters get married the same year, so she called them after the wedding and told them

 "Dont forget to text me your first night experience and text it in code" 

So....... after a week, the 1st daughter texted 

"NESCAFE" 

and the next week the 2nd daughter text 

"BENSON" 

the mother being an intelligent woman went to get a Nescafe tin and read the label 

"fantastic till the last drop"

 went to her husband's pack of Benson cigarette and read 
"Extra long, king size" 

she smiled and said "not bad for their ages". 

After the next week, the 3rd daughter texted 

"NAIROBI to MOMBASA", 

the mother then called Kenya airways helpdesk to enquire about their Nairo-Mombasa flight and they replied 

"it's 3times daily, 7days a week, and the flight duration is  75mins". 

The mother fell down and shouted. 

"igweeeeeeeee!!! This one will  kill my daughter ooooooooo!...............

Dont laugh alone, pass it on.

It is said to be the most advanced Gyro-Stabilized camera system in the world. Filmed from a helicopter with a crew flying from Kathmandu at 4,600 to 24,000 ft.

02/12/17, 12:35 PM - Vishak: The district administration had planned to host the festival from December 23 to January 1. As part of the festival programme, there will be 67 activities, including a palace flower show, a cake festival, cultural programmes, heritage bicycle ride, makkal habba, 3D mapping on Mysuru Palace and the screening of a movie in the open.
At the open movie screening, the public can watch a movie on a huge screen, by sitting inside their vehicles or on their two-wheelers. The authorities are discussing on the list of movies which are to be screened

A flower show, having a large collection of flowers and ornamental plants, will be organized at the Mysuru palace premises. More than 10,000 flowering and ornamental plants will be on display.

Similarly, a day-long 'Open Street Festival' will be organized at D Devaraja Urs road, the commercial hub of the city. The festival which was organized during the Dasara festivities by the tourism department, for the first time in Mysuru city, got a big thumbs-up from locals as well as tourists. The busy road will be made traffic-free on the occasion, and will allow the public to enjoy shopping, playing games and eating and drinking from food stalls on the stretch with leisure.

04/12/17, 10:03 PM - Vishak: ನನ್ನ ಒಬ್ಬ ಸ್ನೇಹಿತನ ಸಂದೇಶ ವಾಟ್ಸಪ್ ಗ್ರೂಪಿನಲ್ಲಿ....

ನಾನು ಕೆಲವು ತಮಿಳರ ವಾಟ್ಸಾಪು ಗುಂಪುಗಳಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಇದ್ದೇನೆ.
ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರ ಗುಂಪುಗಳಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಇದ್ದೇನೆ...ಅಲ್ಲಿನ ಚರ್ಚಾ ವಿಶಯಗಳು ಹೀಗಿವೆ..

ತಮಿಳರ ಗುಂಪುಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆಯುವ ಚರ್ಚೆಗಳು ..
೧. ತಮಿಳರ ಉದ್ಯೋಗ, ನೀಟ್ ಪರೀಕ್ಷಾ ವ್ಯವಸ್ತೆ, ಜಲಗಲಿಕಟ್ಟು 
೨. ತಮಿಳು ಸಿನಿಮಾಗಳು
೩. ಹೊರದೇಶದ ತಮಿಳರ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಗಳು
೪. ತಮಿಳು ಸಾಹಿತ್ಯ 
೫. ತಮಿಳು ನಾಡಿನ ರಾಜಕೀಯ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಗಳು.
ಇತ್ಯಾದಿ..

ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರ ಗುಂಪುಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆಯುವ ಚರ್ಚೆಗಳು 
೧. ಮೋದಿಯ ಮೋಡಿ
೨. ಇಂದು ಅಮಿತ್ ಶಾ ಏನು ಹೇಳಿದರು.
೩. ಗಾಂಧಿಯನ್ನು ಕೊಂದದ್ದು ಏಕೆ ಸರಿ
೪. ನಹರೂ ಮಾಡಿದ ಹಿಂದೂ ವಿರೋಧಿ ಕೆಲಸಗಳು.
೫. ವಿರಾಟ್ ಹಿಂದೂ ಸಮಾವೇಶ 
ಇತ್ಯಾದಿ ಇತ್ಯಾದಿ

ನ್ಯಾಯವಾಗಿ ಚರ್ಚೆಯಾಗಬೇಕಿದ್ದ ವಿಶಯಗಳು.
೧. ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರ ಉದ್ಯೋಗ
೨. ಬೆಂಗಳೂರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಆಗುತ್ತಿರುವ ಎಗ್ಗಿಲ್ಲದ ವಲಸೆ
೩. ಕಾವೇರಿ ಮತ್ತು ಮಹದಾಯಿ
೪. ಹಿಂದೀ ಹೇರಿಕೆಯಿಂದಾಗಿ ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರು ಹೇಗೆ ತಮ್ಮತನವನ್ನು ಕಳೆದುಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ 
೫. ನೀಟ್ ಪರೀಕ್ಷಾ ಪದ್ದತಿಯಿಂದ ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರಿಗೆ ಆಗುತ್ತಿರುವ ಅನ್ಯಾಯಗಳು
ಇತ್ಯಾದಿ..

ಇದೇ ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರಿಗೂ ತಮಿಳರಿಗೂ ಇರುವ ವ್ಯತ್ಯಾಸ...

ತಮಿಳರನ್ನು ಏಕೆ ಪ್ರಪಂಚದ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಜನರೂ ಗೌರವಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ, ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರು ತಮ್ಮ ನೆಲದಲ್ಲೇ ಏಕೆ ಪರಕೀಯರಾಗಿದ್ದಾರೆ ಎನ್ನುವುದು ಇದೇ ಕಾರಣಕ್ಕೆ. 

"ಯಾರದೋ ತಲೆನೋವಿಗೆ ಮುಲಾಮು ಹಚ್ಚಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವ" ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರಿಗೆ ಈ ಸಂದೇಶ ತಲುಪಿಸೋಣ....
ಎಚ್ಚೆತ್ತುಕೊಳ್ಳಿ ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರೇ...

07/12/17, 9:46 AM - Vishak: A sexy Irish blonde at a Casino, seemed a little intoxicated😇
 She bet 20,000 Euro on a single roll of dice.

She said - "I hope you don't mind, but I feel luckier when I'm nude".

With that she removed her clothes, rolled the dice and yelled - "come on baby, Mama needs new clothes!"

As the dice came to a stop, she jumped and yelled - "yes yes, I won.....I won...."

She hugged each dealer and picked up her winnings and clothes and left.

The dealers gazed at each other, dumbfounded. Finally one of them asked - "What number was rolled on the dice?"

The other - "I don't know, I thought you were watching."

Moral of the story:

- not all drunks are drunk
- not all blondes are dumb
- but all Men are Men😂😂😂😂😂

08/12/17, 1:34 PM - Vishak: Government should take steps
08/12/17, 1:34 PM - Vishak: Cause it's national security
08/12/17, 1:36 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: India constitution itself has so many loopholes, I believe in one ruling party for entire India, and there should be opposition too but if someone wins the entire states should come under the winning party
08/12/17, 1:37 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: This is so touching
08/12/17, 1:37 PM - Vishak: No way
08/12/17, 1:37 PM - Vishak: I like federal system in India

08/12/17, 1:39 PM - Vishak: Thing is the opposition is not doing job properly
08/12/17, 1:39 PM - Anni jss: Like BJP at centre and congi here
08/12/17, 1:39 PM - Vishak: Otherwise it is critical to have opposition in democracy
08/12/17, 1:40 PM - Vishak: Imagine if Congress was ruling
08/12/17, 1:40 PM - Vishak: Then would u say the same
08/12/17, 1:40 PM - Anni jss: State govt won't give due credit to centre govt and vice versa
08/12/17, 1:40 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Same man, if congress wins the entire India should come under that, and if BJP wins again same

08/12/17, 1:41 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Which opinion
08/12/17, 1:41 PM - Anni jss: If u see history of Karnataka for last 25-30yrs, state govt different party, centre different party and so Karnataka has not got its benefits like Tamil nadu, andhra
08/12/17, 1:42 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I agree
08/12/17, 1:42 PM - Anni jss: In Tamil nadu whichever govt is there, they support centre govt and take all benefits
08/12/17, 1:42 PM - Vishak: I know what's happening now is opposition is causing more of disruption than any meaningful intervention
08/12/17, 1:42 PM - Vishak: But it is meant for voice from all sides
08/12/17, 1:42 PM - Anni jss: Starting from Kaveri issue, coal, power, nuclear power plant, industries, railways etc
08/12/17, 1:43 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I still remember when this 26/11 happened. Central government ordered domestic military camps in TN and AP and Kerala but not in KAR, because central was Cong and State was BJP
08/12/17, 1:43 PM - Anni jss: If power is with one party, opposition will work more meaningfully
08/12/17, 1:43 PM - Anni jss: Correct
08/12/17, 1:43 PM - Vishak: No man that powerful party might miss use it too
08/12/17, 1:44 PM - Anni jss: Airports if u see, Karnataka has only one major.. sports development, Bangalore is the only one to host a intl cricket match.. where as others have 2-3 intl stadiums
08/12/17, 1:44 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Even the mandate has to happen for entire nation at once, like US. Then you will have opinion
08/12/17, 1:44 PM - Anni jss: That's y in USA only two terms for a party
08/12/17, 1:44 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Hope, if they misuse it then next time they will lose, like UPA this time
08/12/17, 1:45 PM - Anni jss: Opposition will work better if they mis use
08/12/17, 1:45 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Many loopholes in Constitution, the intelligent people now has to rewrite or optimize it little bit
08/12/17, 1:45 PM - Vishak: U will never know the fact they are miss using
08/12/17, 1:45 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: For this generation
08/12/17, 1:46 PM - Anni jss: How much money aren't we wasting for central elections and then state elections, district elections, panchayat elections, BBMP elections, civic body elections etc
08/12/17, 1:46 PM - Vishak: Tat I agree
08/12/17, 1:46 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Its totally wrong, everyone will know who is doing right or wrong. You can't hide that man
08/12/17, 1:46 PM - Anni jss: Instead, one election for whole country and that will rule all the constitutional bodies for 5yrs
08/12/17, 1:46 PM - Vishak: Dude India is big country

08/12/17, 1:47 PM - Vishak: But not vast as India
08/12/17, 1:47 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Same people should not stand for election, new candidates has to come, they can set 10 years max per person and they shouldn't compete again
08/12/17, 1:47 PM - Anni jss: So what? Since more ppl, more ppl want power.. that's why all these central, state, district, Zilla, civic body elections
08/12/17, 1:47 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: This is correct
08/12/17, 1:48 PM - Vishak: It won't work
08/12/17, 1:48 PM - Vishak: It's not europe
08/12/17, 1:48 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Now KAR losing some benefits from central cause of this only

08/12/17, 1:51 PM - Vishak: But there will also be centre controling all of them

08/12/17, 1:51 PM - Vishak: States are independent in tat sense

08/12/17, 2:45 PM - Vishak: If talk about Buddhism also it's kind of copy of Hinduism with everything Buddha in centre
08/12/17, 2:45 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: That is y, even after ruled 800 years by other religion rulers. Hindus are still at 80% in India
08/12/17, 2:45 PM - Vishak: 🤦🏻‍♂

10/12/17, 10:25 PM - Vishak: Men's Pearls of Wisdom😍

🌾1. When I was born, I was given a choice - A big dick or a good memory. I don't remember, what I chose.

🌾2. Your birth certificate is an apology letter from the condom factory.

🌾3. A wife is a sex object. Every time you ask for sex, she objects.

🌾4. Impotence: Nature's way of saying 'No hard feelings...'

🌾5. There are only two four letter words that are offensive to men - 'don't' and 'stop', unless they are used together.

🌾6. Panties: Not the best thing on earth, but next to the best thing on earth.

🌾7. There are three stages of sex in a man's life: Tri Weekly, Try Weekly, and Try Weakly.

🌾8. Virginity can be cured.

🌾9. Virginity is not dignity, its lack of opportunity.

🌾10. Having sex is like playing bridge. If you don't have a good partner, you'd better have a good hand.

🌾11. I tried phone sex once, but the holes in the dialer were too small.

🌾12. Marriage is the only war where you get to sleep with the enemy.

🌾13. Q: What's an Australian kiss?
      A: The same thing as a French kiss, only down under.

🌾14. A couple just married were happy with the whole thing. He was happy with the Hole and she was happy with the Thing......

🌾15. Q: What are the three biggest tragedies in a mans life?
     A: Life sucks, job sucks, and the wife doesn't

🌾16. Q: Why do men find it difficult to make eye contact?
     A: Breasts don't have eyes.

🌾17. Despite the old saying, ' Don 't take your troubles to bed', many men still sleep with their wives!!

🌾18. Breasts are proof that men can focus on 2 things at a time

Send to the men with a good sense of humour ...

14/12/17, 11:07 PM - Vishak: The Government is proposing a Bill by which if the bank is having financial difficulties then they can ask depositors to take a hit.

The Finance Ministry have got a Bill approved by the Cabinet called 
"The Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, 2017" and this has now been referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee before getting it passed in the Parliament.

This Bill introduces the provision for a “bail-in”, whose purpose is to provide capital to absorb the losses of a bank and ensure its survival. Here, survival does not mean safety of depositors’ money, but restoration of capital of the bank. 
The bail-in empowers the bank to cancel a liability owed by the bank or change the form of an existing liability to another security.

*In simple words, it means that your savings account balance of Rs.15 lacs, can be reduced to Rs.1 lac, which is mandatory by law.*
 OR they can convert your savings account balance of Rs.15 lacs to a Fixed Deposit, repayable after 5 years, giving you of 5% annual interest. 

And you can do nothing about it. 
View this link, to know more. http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/banking-on-legislation/article20005363.ece

To recover the money from the defaulters, there is no attempt so far by the Reserve Bank of India to blacklist these entities from getting further loans or prevent their managements from retaining a majority equity stake, as penalty for the huge haircuts (writing off loans) being taken by banks.

*In a nut-shell they are now trying to shift the responsibility of rescuing the "sinking banks" from the Govt. to the Suppliers & Depositors of the Bank.* 
Trust in Banking Industry would be decimated. People would gradually close all their bank accounts and keep their cash under the bed. 

Share this extensively thru' every social media. This bill should not be allowed to become an act.

16/12/17, 1:34 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Annual  apology

 Over the past few months I have forwarded some inappropriate pictures and jokes to friends who I thought shared the same sense of humor.. 

Unfortunately this wasn't the case and I seem to have upset quite a few people who have accused me of being sexist and shallow..  

If you were one of these people, please accept my sincerest apologies. 

Looking to 2018 onward, I will only post or send e-mail with a cultural or educational content such as old monuments, nature and other interesting topics.  

Below is a picture of the Pont Neuf Bridge in Paris .  It is the oldest bridge in Paris and took 26 years to build.   It was completed in 1604..

21/12/17, 1:11 PM - hrushikesh ms: A True Incident
In the yr 1979, near the Trivandrum sea shore an Elderly Gentleman was reading the Bhagavad Gita. That time, a young Talented Atheist guy came & sat besides that Gentleman.
The young guy Taunted the Gentleman by saying that in the age of science, people are so foolish that they read old fashioned books like the Gita.

He further said that, had you devoted this same time to science, then by now the country would have scaled great heights.

The Gentleman asked the young man for his introduction to which the youth replied that he was a science graduate from Kolkata who had come to make his career in Bhabha Atomic Research Center.

The youth further told the Gentleman go devote his attention to scientific research as by reading the Bhagavad Gita, he wouldn't be able to achieve anything.
The Gentleman smiled & got up to leave. As soon as he got up, his four security guards surrounded him & his driver brought his red beacon fitted official car. Seeing all this the youth panicked & asked the Gentleman, who are U.
The Gentleman replied that his name is Vikram Sarabhai, the Chairman of the same organization, where the youth had come to make his career.
At that point of time, there were 13 research organizations in the name of Vikram Sarabhai, along with which he was also the Chairman of Commitee for Atomic Planning, having being appointed to the same by the PM Indira Gandhi.
Now, it was the turn of the youth to be ashamed & he fell down on Sarabhai's feet, crying profusely. It was then that Sarabhai said a very Wonderful thing.

He said, "*Behind every creation, there's always the Creator. So, it doesn't matter, whether it is the time of the Mahabharat or Today's India. Never Forget God !!!
Today's Atheist people, by invoking the name of science, may dance as much as they want but history is witness that Science has been created by God believing Theists only.
*God is Eternal Truth. God's speech (Bhagavad Gita) is true; it cannot be Falsified at all. Just by worshipping it, troubles will surely get resolved.*

22/12/17, 3:21 PM - Vishak: I asked my friend who was having a Rs 60000/- bike, which fuel he was using. 
He replied, it's Petrol. 

When I asked why don't you try Kerosene?  His reply was, the engine will be spoiled. 

I again asked him, do you drink alcohol?? 

He quietly said 'yes'.

When I questioned, won't it spoil your engine??? 

He humbly replied, it's only occasionally... 

My question is, can we pour kerosene occasionally in our bike for a change??? 

No - we cannot. 

We give more value to our Rs 60000 bike but not for our life. 

Our life is more valuable and more Important.

23/12/17, 10:06 PM - Vishak: Talk politics ter
23/12/17, 10:07 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: I am not imposing violence panda, see the thing is we should love and respect both religion but here in India from last few years as I observed they are giving importance to only Christian and Muslim festivals and they have disregarded all the Hindu festivals, the best and the recent example is Hanuman Jayanti
23/12/17, 10:07 PM - Vishak: Simply talking shit all time
23/12/17, 10:07 PM - Vishak: Wat happened in Hanuman jayanti ?

23/12/17, 10:09 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Hanuman Jayanti they have band the procession and instead of that one they have given permission for some muslim festival I don't know I forgot its name
23/12/17, 10:09 PM - Lola Infosys: They didn't allow posters also. But tippu jayanti was done grandly. See Pratap Simha tweets

23/12/17, 10:12 PM - Vishak: Any time by minorities
23/12/17, 10:12 PM - Vishak: Ter only u find the answer
23/12/17, 10:13 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Saving Hinduism nowadays has become a vital part, because so much of conversion. see I am not dividing between UPA and NDA  but if you observe closely whatever the opposition happening for the Hindus and Hindu festival that particular state government is always Congress or communist or leftist party so why I personally support BJP is because hindutva and for you also Panda before loving the world you should love yourself your mother father and your family. because if you can't love and protect your family nobody can and nobody will
23/12/17, 10:14 PM - Vishak: Lo if u see tat take action
23/12/17, 10:14 PM - Vishak: I won't stop
23/12/17, 10:14 PM - Vishak: But don't be in presumption
23/12/17, 10:15 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: And it is still presumption even with the data and the daily things which are happening around us

23/12/17, 10:21 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: When people opposing digital India how can we get a copy of the implementation or The Exodus whatever the thing happening in Kashmir without being there
23/12/17, 10:22 PM - Theja: Great minds discuss ideas; averageminds discuss events; small minds discuss people
23/12/17, 10:22 PM - Vishak: Thing is I can't change u but my only advice is everyone has the right to have opinion but don't impose on all, secondly act on facts and third is wat is the point talking so extensively when u never going to take part in solving any of those
23/12/17, 10:25 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: See the thing is that even I can change you but if somebody is trying to burn my home I cannot tie my hands and surrender I will fight. it's just that I don't have power right now and as I read some great man told pen is mightier than sword, if you can't express you cannot do also, every action starts with awareness and discussion this is what I am doing here.
23/12/17, 10:26 PM - Vishak: Ok peace out😁

Swear - lo shaata! 

Greeting - Yeno shaatve..

Sarcasm - Hu haudu shaata.

Surprise - yen guru Shaata idu!!

Comparison - Neen nan mundhe shaatanu illa..

Challenge - yen Shaata kithkothiya naanoo nodthini!!

Degrading - magne yellardru hogi Shaata thari.

Disappointment - iden Shaata guru iduu..

Denial - Shaata nu illa.

Insult - Neen nan Shaatad samaana. 

don't care - ayyo nan shaatakkenu. 
 
Ignorance - nangen gottu shaata?

And the most important one: 
Order - SHAATA THERI!!!! 😂😂

Shaata thariyakke kalsilla idanna... yella share madrappa. 😜😜

Time flies
Dreams are still up in the skies..

From appreciation to promotion
Got memorable things in professional life
From friendship to love n care
Got lovely feelings in personal life..

I saw in her eyes
What she couldn't explain in words..
I felt in my heart
What people cannot express in art..

I lost my whole
When i saw her with stole..
I lost my track
When i saw her in black..

I loved her style
When she had a smile..
I felt my life was a fail
When she was pale..

My life was full
When she smiled mouthful..
My life was null
When she was dull..

There were days
My eyes were full of tears..
There were days
My heart was happiest in years..

From goa to America
Saw numerous places around world..
From food to drinks
Tried everything but always needed curd..

There ain't no regrets
For all my deeds..
There isn't an end
For all my needs..

Life is good
With mixture of bitter n butter..
Things could have been better
If the bitter turned sweeter..

Bye bye
2017
Hi Hi
2018

Time flies
Dreams are still up in the skies..
When going gets tough
Tough gets going..

03/01/18, 4:40 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Sydney blew up 8,000 kg of fireworks last night. Dubai scored a Guinness World Record by launching 479,651 firework shells in 6 minutes. And these are just 2 places of 2 cities out of 4,416 other cities that celebrated new year's eve. Not a single celebrity cringed. No one cried. Nobody's dog had a problem. Instead there were selfies, smiles and joy all around. And the best part is that with such a gigantic production, the whole world must be totally oxygenated today. Feels so awesome, no? New Year's Eve is a mysterious night for every scientist & chemical engineer. 

Because this is the only time in the year when firecrackers emit oxygen. That's why despite all the fireworks throughout the world, no environmentalist has a problem, because it emits only oxygen today, while on other days, and especially on festivals like Deepavali, it emits carbon dioxide & all kinds of toxins. 

This is something which has puzzled scientists worldwide & has still remained a mystery.
03/01/18, 4:40 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: ಓದಲು ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿದೆ...

ವಯಸ್ಸು 20 ಇರುವಾಗ "ಸ್ವದೇಶ" ಮತ್ತು "ವಿದೇಶ " ಎರಡೂ ಒಂದೇ. (ನೀವು ಎಲ್ಲಿದ್ದರೂ ಪರವಾಗಿಲ್ಲ. ಅಲ್ಲಿಗೆ ಹೊಂದಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವಿರಿ)

ವಯಸ್ಸು 30 ಆದಾಗ " ರಾತ್ರಿ" ಮತ್ತು "ಹಗಲು " ಎರಡೂ ಒಂದೇ ( ಕೆಲವು ದಿನ ನಿದ್ದೆ ಇಲ್ಲ ದಿದ್ದರೂ ಏನೂ ತೊಂದರೆ ಆಗಲ್ಲ)

ವಯಸ್ಸು 40 ಆದಾಗ " ಅತಿ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಓದಿದವರು" ಮತ್ತು "ಕಡಿಮೆ ಓದಿದವರು " ಒಂದೇ ( ಕಡಿಮೆ ಓದಿದವರೂ ಕೆಲವೊಮ್ಮೆ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಸಂಪಾದಿ ಸುತ್ತಾರೆ)

ವಯಸ್ಸು 50 ಆದಾಗ 
ಸೌಂದರ್ಯ ಮತ್ತು ಕುರೂಪ ಒಂದೇ (ನೀವು ಎಷ್ಟೇ ಸುಂದರವಾಗಿದ್ದರೂ ಚರ್ಮ ನೆರಿಗೆ ಬೀಳುವುದು, ಅಲ್ಲಲ್ಲಿ ಕಪ್ಪಾಗುವುದು ಮುಚ್ಚಿಡಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ)

ವಯಸ್ಸು 60 ಆದಾಗ ಎತ್ತರದ ಸ್ಥಾನ, ಕೆಳಗಿನ ಸ್ಥಾನ ಒಂದೇ (ನಿವೃತ್ತಿ ಗೊಂಡ ಮೇಲೆ ಪೇದೆ ಆಗಿದ್ದವನೂ ಮೇನೇಜರ್ ಗೆ ಹಿಂದಿನ ಗೌರವ ಕೊಡಲಾರ)

ವಯಸ್ಸು 70 ಆದಾಗ "ದೊಡ್ಡ ಮನೆ " ಮತ್ತು "ಸಣ್ಣ ಮನೆ " ಒಂದೇ... (ಸಂದು ನೋವು, ಚಲಿಸಲು ಕಷ್ಟ, ಇದ್ದವರಿಗೆ ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ಜಾಗ ಕೂರಲು ಸಿಕ್ಕರೆ ಸಾಕು)

ವಯಸ್ಸು 80 ಆದಾಗ "ಹಣ ಇರುವುದು "   ಹಣ ಇಲ್ಲದಿರುವುದು ಒಂದೇ (ನಿಮಗೆ ಹಣ ಖರ್ಚು  ಮಾಡಬೇಕೆನ್ನಿಸಿದರೂ ಎಲ್ಲಿ ಖರ್ಚು ಮಾಡಬೇಕೆಂದು ತಿಳಿಯುವುದಿಲ್ಲ)

ವಯಸ್ಸು 90 ಆದಾಗ " ನಿದ್ದೆ ಮಾಡೋದು ಹಾಗೂ " ಎಚ್ಚರದಿಂದಿರುವುದು " ಎರಡೂ ಒಂದೇ (ಎದ್ದ ಮೇಲೆ ಏನು ಮಾಡಬೇಕೆಂದು ಗೊತ್ತಿರುವುದಿಲ್ಲ)

ಜೀವನವನ್ನು ಹಗುರವಾಗಿ ತೆಗೊಳ್ಳಿ'... ಅಲ್ಲಿ ಭೇದಿಸಬೇಕಾದ 
ರಹಸ್ಯಗಳು ಇಲ್ಲ...

ದೀರ್ಘಾವದಿಯ ಜೀವನ ನೋಡಿದರೆ ನಾವೆಲ್ಲಾ ಒಂದೇ '
ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಒತ್ತಡ / ಆತಂಕ ಗಳನ್ನು ಮರೆತು ಜೀವನವನ್ನು ಆನಂದಿಸಿರಿ.

05/01/18, 1:59 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: A young sexy  woman passing by a pet shop saw a board -  "Monkey who does great sex".
She went in, bought that monkey & walked away with the Instruction Manual.
The Manual said "Give a good bath to the monkey, then you take a bath. Make him sit on the bed and you lie down without wearing anything. Leave the rest to the monkey. Repeat all steps for repeat performance".
Accordingly, the woman gave the monkey a bath, bathed herself and slept on the bed naked. Monkey did nothing.
Disappointed, she again gave him a bath, had bath and lied down naked on the bed.
Again, the monkey did nothing.
She referred the Manual to check for forward path. It said : In case of no activity, call the shop owner for support.
She called the owner & he arrived in 10 minutes.
He asked the woman to lie down. He then looked at the monkey and shouted...
"This is the last time I'm teaching you..!"

05/01/18, 5:09 PM - Arun Bhadardwaj: Famed actor Arnold Schwarzenegger posted a photo of him sleeping on the street under his famous bronze statue, and sadly wrote "how times have changed". The reason he wrote the phrase was not only because he was old, but because when he was governor of California he inaugurated a hotel with his statue. Hotel staff told Arnold, "at any moment you can come and have a room reserved for you." when Arnold stepped down as governor and went to the hotel, the administration refused to give him a room arguing that he should pay for it, since they were in great demand.
He brought a sleeping bag and stood underneath the statue and explained what he wanted to convey: "When I was in an important position, they always complimented me, and when I lost this position, they forgot about me and did not keep their promise. Do not trust your position or the amount of money you have, nor your power, nor your intelligence, it will not last. "

Trying to teach everyone that when you're "Important" in the people's eyes , everyone is your "Friend" But once you don't benefit their interests , you won't matter.

"Nothing lasts forever."

05/01/18, 6:55 PM - Lola Infosys: During a company's annual family trip to a crocodile farm in Thailand... the eccentric Boss dared any of his employees to jump into the crocodiles infested pond... and swim to the shore.

Anyone who survived the swim will be rewarded with 5 million... but if killed by the crocs...2 million will be given to the next of kin.

For a long period of time no one dared take up the challenge... then suddenly a man jumped in...and swam frantically for his life towards shore pursued by the crocs...and luckily he made it unscathed.

When he managed to recover his breath... the man, who became instant millionaire, shouted asking who pushed him into the pond..... it was his wife who did it.!!!

And from that day...that was how the phrase... "Behind every successful man...there's a woman"...came about !!!😜🤣

09/01/18, 6:05 PM - Vishak: But not to say in 70 years actually the improvement which was expected backward community is very less percentage so in someway u can say the reservation system is flawed
09/01/18, 6:14 PM - Anni jss: Reservation system was not flawed.. ambedkar did it with a clear intention.. but people and politicians miss utilizing
09/01/18, 6:26 PM - Theja: Even after 600 years we have casteism,

19/01/18, 4:09 PM - Lola Infosys: Mr. Dickson had a habit of asking daft questions to his pupils.
 
One day, he asked his 4th graders if anyone knew how to put 2 holes into 1 hole.
 
Since no one was able to answer the question, he told the kids to go home and ask their fathers.
 
Kids came back the next day. No one knew the answer.
 
"Look," said Mr. Dickson, quite enjoying himself while holding his index finger against his thumb, forming a little 'zero'. "This is one hole, my nose has 2 holes, and I can put my hand over my nose and make my nose holes appear inside this other hole."
 
"Ahh, right" said the children.
 
The next day, Little Johnny stood up and said, "Mr. Dickson, my daddy wants to know if you know how to put 7 holes in one hole."
 
"Hmmmm," Mr. Dickson said, "How do you put 7 holes in one? Well, I'll be darned. I don't know how to do that. Um, did your father tell you how to?"
 
"Yes," said Little Johnny, "He asked me to tell you, 'Take a flute and shove it up your ass!'"
