ಸಿನಿಮಾಗೆ ಸ್ಟಾರ್ಟಿಂಗಿಲ್ಲ, ಎಂಡಿಂಗಿಲ್ಲ..! ಆರಂಭದಲ್ಲೇ ಎಂಡ್ ಟೈಟಲ್, ಎಂಡಿಂಗಲ್ಲಿ ಟೈಟಲ್ ಕಾರ್ಡ್..! ಅದರ ನಡುವೆ ಫ್ಯೂಚರ್ರಿಲ್ಲ, ಪಾಸ್ಟ್ ಇಲ್ಲ.. ಓನ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರೆಸೆಂಟ್..! ಇದೊಂದು ಟಿಪಿಕಲ್ ಉಪ್ಪಿ ಸಿನಿಮಾ..! ಉಪ್ಪಿಯಿಂದ ಏನು ಬೇಕೋ ಅದೆಲ್ಲಾ ಇಲ್ಲಿದೆ, ಹಂಗಂತ ಈಸಲ ಹಂಗಿರಲ್ಲ ಅನ್ಕೊಂಡು ಹೋಗಿದ್ರೆ ಹಂಗೇ ಇದೆ ಅಂತ ಅನ್ಕೊಂಡು ಬಂದ್ರು ಆಶ್ಚರ್ಯ ಇಲ್ಲ..! ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿಲ್ಲ ಅಂತ ಹೇಳಿದ್ರೆ ಉಪ್ಪಿ ಫ್ಯಾನ್ಸ್ ಒಪ್ಪಲ್ಲ, ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿದೆ ಅಂದ್ರೆ `ಬೇರೆಯವರ’ ಫ್ಯಾನ್ಸ್ ಒಪ್ಪಲ್ಲ..! ಸಿನಿಮಾ ಇಷ್ಟಪಡೋಕೆ ಕಾರಣ ಇಲ್ಲ, ಇಷ್ಟಪಡದೇ ಇರೋಕೆ ಸಾಧ್ಯವೇ ಇಲ್ಲ..! ಹಂಗೆ ಹಿಂಗೆ ಹೆಂಗೇ ನೋಡಿದ್ರೂ ಉಪ್ಪಿ2, ವೆರಿ ವೆರಿ ಡಿಫರೆಂಟು…!
ನಾನು ಮತ್ತು ನೀನು ಇಡೀ ಸಿನಿಮಾದಲ್ಲಿ ಆವರಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ, ಆದ್ರೆ ಅ ನಾನು ಮತ್ತು ನೀನು ಇಬ್ರೂ ಒಂದೇನಾ ಅಂತ ನಾನೂ ಹೇಳಕ್ಕಾಗಲ್ಲ, ನೀನೂ ಹೇಳಕ್ಕಾಗಲ್ಲ..! ಯೋಚನೆ ಮಾಡಬೇಡಿ, ಯೋಚನೆ ಮಾಡಬೇಡಿ ಅನ್ನೋ ನೀನು, ನಾನು ಅಂದ್ರೆ ಇದೇ ನೀನು ಇರಬಹುದಾ ಅಂತ ಯೋಚನೆ ಮಾಡಿಸೋದು ಗ್ಯಾರಂಟಿ..! ಆದ್ರೆ ಕೊನೆ ತನಕ ಸಿನಿಮಾ ನೋಡಿದ್ರು ನೀನು ಮತ್ತು ನಾನು ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಕಂಪ್ಲೀಟ್ ಪಿಕ್ಚರ್ ಸಿಗಲ್ಲ..! ಕೆಲವರ ಕಣ್ಣಿಗೆ ನೀನು ಮತ್ತು ನಾನು ಒಬ್ಬನೇ, ಮತ್ತೆ ಕೆಲವರಿಗೆ ನೀನೂನೇ ಬೇರೆ, ನಾನೂನೇ ಬೇರೆ..! ಟೋಟಲಿ ನಾನು ನಾನು ಅನ್ನೋನ್ ನಾನಲ್ಲ, ನೀನೂ ನೀನೂ ಅನ್ನೋನ್ ನೀನಲ್ಲ..!

ಹಾಡುಗಳು ಬರೀ ಕೇಳೋದಕ್ಕಿಂತ ನೋಡುದ್ರೆ ಸೂಪರ್ರಾಗಿ ಕಾಣುತ್ತೆ..! ಹಾಡು ಅರ್ಥ ಆಗುತ್ತೆ..! ಎಲ್ಲರ ಕಾಲೆಳೆಯೋ ಟೈಮಲ್ಲಿ ಬೀಳೋ ಸೀಟಿಗೆ ಹಾಡೇ ಕೇಳಲ್ಲ, ಅದ್ರಲ್ಲಿ ಉಪ್ಪಿ ಹಾಕಿರೋ ಓಂ ಶಿವಣ್ಣನ ಗೆಟಪ್ ಸೂಪರ್ ಕಣ್ಲಾ..! ಅದ್ದದ್ದೆ ಬದ್ದದ್ದೆ ಅನ್ನೋ ಡೈಲಾಗ್ ಸಿನಿಮಾದಲ್ಲಿಲ್ಲ, ಡೈಲಾಗೇ ಡೈ ಹೊಡೆದು ಲಾಗ ಹಾಕೋ ಡೈಲಾಗಿಗೇನು ಕಮ್ಮಿ ಇಲ್ಲ..! ಏನೇ ಹೇಳಿ, ಏನೂ ಇಲ್ಲದಿದ್ದರೂ ಏನೋ ಇದೆ ಅಂತ ಹೇಳದೇ ಇರೋಕಾಗಲ್ಲ..!
ಹೀರೋಯಿನ್ ಸೌಂದರ್ಯ ಮಾದಕ, ಪಾರೂಲ್ ಬಂದುಹೋಗೋದು ಶುಗರ್ ಜಾಸ್ತಿ ಇರೋ ಪಾನಕ, ಹೀರೋಯಿನ್ ಡೈಲಾಗಿದೆ ಲಿಂಪ್ ಸಿಂಕ್ ಆಗದೇ ಇರೋದು ಯಾತಕ..? ತೆಲುಗೂಗು ಸೆಟ್ ಆಗ್ಲಿ ಅಂತ ಮಾಡಿರೋದು 100% ಪಕ್ಕಾ..! ಅದು ಬಿಟ್ರೆ ಉಪ್ಪಿ2 ಹೊಳೀತದೆ ಲಕಲಕ..!
ಸಿನಿಮಾಗೆ ಸ್ಟೋರಿ ಇಲ್ಲ ಅಂತ ಹೇಳೋದೂ ಕಷ್ಟ, ಸ್ಟೋರಿ ಇದೆ ಅನ್ನೋದಾದ್ರೆ ಅದನ್ನ ಹೇಳಿ ಅಂದ್ರೂ ಕಷ್ಟ..! ಹಿಂದೇನಾಗಿತ್ತು ಅಂತ ನೆನಪಿಟ್ಟುಕಳ್ಳದೇ, ಮುಂದೇನಾಗುತ್ತೆ ಅಂತ ಯೋಚನೆ ಮಾಡದೇ, ಸಿನಿಮಾನ ಉಪ್ಪಿ ಸಿನಿಮಾ ಅಂತ ನೋಡುದ್ರೆ ಸಿನಿಮಾ ಸೂಪರ್..! ಒಳಗೆ ಹೋದಾಗ ಹೇಗೆ ಹೋಗಿರ್ತಿರೋ ಹಾಗೇ ಹೊರಗೆ ಬಂದ್ರೆ ಓಕೆ, ಏನಾದ್ರೂ ಹುಳ ಬಿಟ್ಕೊಂಡ್ರೆ ಅದು ಲೈಫ್ ಲಾಂಗ್ ತಲೆಯಿಂದ ಹೊರಗೆ ಹೋಗಲ್ಲ..! ಎಲ್ಲಿಂದ ಶುರುವಾಗುತ್ತೋ ಅಲ್ಲಿಗೇ ಕೊನೆಯಾಗೋ ಉಪ್ಪಿ2 ಮುಗಿದ ಮೇಲೂ, ಇನ್ನೂ ಏನೋ ಇರಬಹುದು ಅಂತ ಜನ ಕಾಯ್ತಾ ಇದ್ರು..! ಅದೇ ಉಪ್ಪಿ2….! ಅರ್ಥ ಮಾಡ್ಕೊಳೋಕೆ ಸಿನಿಮಾಗೆ ಹೋಗಬೇಡಿ, ಸಿನಿಮಾಗೆ ಹೋಗಿ ಅರ್ಥ ಮಾಡ್ಕೊಳೋ ಪ್ರಯತ್ನ ಮಾಡಬೇಡಿ. ಅದು ಅರ್ಥ ಆಗಲ್ಲ, ಅರ್ಥ ಆದ್ರೆ ಅದು ಉಪ್ಪಿ ಸಿನಿಮಾ ಅಲ್ಲ..! ಎಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ಇಷ್ಟ ಆಗೋ ಗ್ಯಾರಂಟಿ ಇಲ್ಲ, ಆದ್ರೆ ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿಲ್ಲ ಅಂತ ಹೇಳೋದೂ ಸುಲಭ ಇಲ್ಲ..! ಏನೂ ಇಲ್ಲದಿದ್ದರೂ ಎಲ್ಲವೂ ಇರುವ, ಎಲ್ಲವೂ ಇದ್ದರೂ ಏನೂ ಇಲ್ಲದಿರುವ, ಇದ್ದರೂ ಇಲ್ಲ ಎನಿಸುವ, ಇಲ್ಲದಿದ್ದರೂ ಏನೋ ಇದೆ ಅನಿಸುವ ಸಿನಿಮಾದ ಹೆಸರು ಉಪ್ಪಿ2..! ಯೋಚ್ನೆ ಮಾಡ್ಬೇಡಿ.. ಒಂದು ಸಲ ನೋಡಿಬಿಡಿ..! ಅಂಡ್ ನೋಡಿ-ಬಿಡಿ…!

Husband decided to do yoga. As he was getting ready, the wife wakes up and opened her eyes. So the husband asked her-"Honey would you like to join me for Yoga?"Wife: "Do you mean to say I am fat?"Husband: "No no. If you don't want to get up, it's OK."Wife: "So now you think I am lazy, ha?"Husband: "No. You are misunderstanding me. I didn't mean...."Wife: "Aha! So I don't understand you, right?"Husband: "Now look I didn't say that."Wife: "So am I lieng?!!"Husband: "All right! Its best I also don't go for Yoga:Wife: "See! You never wanted to go. Just wanted to blame me."The husband quietly goes to sleep. 😥

20/08/2015, 6:58 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Can u judge who is the better person out of these 3 ?

Mr A - He had frienship with bad politicians, consults astrologers, two wives, chain smoker, drinks eight to 10 times a day.

Mr B - He was kicked out of office twice, sleeps till noon, used opium in college & drinks whiskey every evening.

Mr C - He is a decorated war hero,a vegetarian, doesn't smoke , doesn't drink  and never cheated on his wife.

You would want Mr.C rite.

















But..
Mr. A was Franklin Roosevelt!

Mr. B was Winston Churchill!!

Mr C Was ADOLF HITLER!!! 

Strange but true..
Its risky to judge anyone by his habits !
Character is a complex phenomenon.

So every person in ur life is important ,don't judge them ,accept them.
 Three beautiful thoughts  

1. None can destroy iron, but its own rust can! 
Likewise, none can destroy a person, but his own mindset can.

2. Ups and downs in life are very important to keep us going, because a straight line even in an E.C.G. means we are not alive.

3. The same Boiling Water that hardens the egg, Will Soften the Potato!
It depends upon Individual's reaction To stressful circumstances!



Beautiful saying ---
Mobile has taught us three things ....
Whatever makes you happy  -- save it.....
Whatever makes others happy -- forward it.....
Whatever will make no one happy -- Delete it...

 Why Kattappa Killed Bahubali?


 Bahubali makes Devasena Pregnant without marriage. Kattappa Comes to know about this.
Kattappa in conversation with Bahubali

Kattappa : "ತಾಳಿ ಕಟ್ಟಪ್ಪ"(tie the taali)

Bahubali : "ತಾಳಿ  ಕಟ್ಟಪ್ಪ" (Meaning "Wait Kattappa") 

Kattappa (Confused): "ತಾಳಿ ಕಟ್ಟಪ್ಪ"(tie the taali) 

Bahubali (Gave up) : "ತಾಳಿ, ಕಟ್ಟಪ್ಪ" (Give me the taali kattappa).

Kattappa thinks bahubali is making fun of him by repeating his words.

Kattappa (angry) : "ನೀನು ಕಟ್ಟಪ್ಪ" (you tie the taali) 

BahuBali (Confused) : "ನೀನು ಕಟ್ಟಪ್ಪ" (You are kattappa <Not Me>)

Kattappa feels humiliated and insulted and could not control his anger there by killing Bahubali. 😂😂😂😂😂

ಹುಟ್ಟಿದಾಗ ನೀ ಅಳುತ್ತಿದ್ದೆ,
 ಮಡಿದಾಗ ನಿನ್ನವರು ಅಳುತ್ತಿದ್ದರು.

ಹುಟ್ಟಿದಾಗ ನಿನಗೆ ವಸ್ತ್ರ ತೊಡಿಸುವರು,
  ಮಡಿದಾಗ ನಿನ್ನ ವಸ್ತ್ರವ ಬಿಚ್ಚುವರು.

ಹುಟ್ಟಿದಾಗ  ಹುಡುಕುವರು ನಿನಗೆ ನೂರೆಂಟು ನಾಮ,
   ಮಡಿದಮೇಲೆ ಶವ ಎಂದೇ ನಿನ್ನ ನಾಮ.

 ನೀನೇನನ್ನೂ ಗಳಿಸದೇ ಬಂದೆ, 
   ಮಡಿದಾಗ ನೀನು ಗಳಸಿದ್ದನ್ನು ಕಳದುಕೊಂಡೆ.
 
ಓ ಮಾನವಾ..
      ಮಡಿದಾಗ ಮಣ್ಣಲ್ಲಿ ಮರಳಾಗಿ ಹೊಗುವ ನೀನು
            ನಿನ್ನದು ಎನ್ನಲು ನಿನಗೇನಿದೆ,
ನಿನಗೆ ಜನ್ಮ ಕೊಟ್ಟವರು ಮತ್ತೊಬ್ಬರು,
ನಿನಗೆ ಹೆಸರು ಕೊಟ್ಟದ್ದು ಮತ್ತೊಬ್ಬರು,
ನಿನಗೆ ಜ್ಙಾನ ಹೇಳಿ ಕೊಟ್ಟದ್ದು ಮತ್ತೊಬ್ಬರು,
ಕಡೆಗೆ ನಿನ್ನ ಅಂತ್ಯ ಸಂಸ್ಕಾರ ನಿರ್ವಹಿಸುವುದು ಕೂಡಾ ಮತ್ತೊಬ್ಬರೇ...
ನಾನು ಎಂದು ಅಹಂಕರಿಸಲು ನಾನು ಯಾರು
    ಏನಿದೇ ನನ್ನಲ್ಲಿ.

ಚಿಂತಿಸುವವನಿಗೆ ದೃಷ್ಟಾಂತವಿದೆ

03/09/2015, 8:04 pm - Abhilash: 3 Fucking Laws of Management - If you learn them, no one can beat you in Corporate Management, but unfortunately even Harvard Business School does not teach them.




1. Fucking Law of Delivery Time - No matter how hard and fast you fuck, the child comes after 9 months.
Moral - Pressurizing does not alter delivery period.











2. Fucking Law of Direction - Even though both holes  are nearby, if by a wrong shot, you enter the wrong hole, no matter how hard you fuck, you never get a child.
Moral - Right direction is very important to get the results, even few centimeters away from right direction, even if it gives satisfaction, cannot lead to results.




3. Fucking Law of Human Resources - By appointing 4 men to fuck 1 woman, you cannot get 4 children, but if you appoint one man and 4 women, you can get 4 children.
Moral - Appoint the right person at the right position. Otherwise you would keep on wondering, why you are not getting the results even after appointing more men.         
😁😜😝
End of management Gyaan!

11/09/2015, 9:55 pm - Bhavan Play: Mindblowing.......

1st yr MBBS students were attending their 1st anatomy class. They all gathered around the table with real dead body. The professor started the class by telling them two important qualities as a doctor. The 1st is that never be disgusted about anything regarding the body e.g. he inserted his finger in the body's nose & on drawing back, put the finger in his own mouth & tasted it. Then he told the students to do the same. The students hesitated for several minutes, but eventually everyone inserted their fingers in the body's nose & tasted it. When everyone finished the professor looked at them & said :The most important 2nd quality is Observation. I inserted my middle finger but tasted the index finger. Now learn to pay attention

All students : shitttt !!

ತಮ್ಮ ಒಡೆಯನಿಗೆ ಅಂಜುತ್ತಾ ಬದುಕಿದವರಿಗಾಗಿ, ತಳದಲ್ಲಿ ನದಿಗಳು ಹರಿಯುತ್ತಿರುವ ಉದ್ಯಾನಗಳಿವೆ. ಅವರು ಸದಾ ಕಾಲ ಅವುಗಳಲ್ಲಿರುವರು. ಇದು ಅಲ್ಲಾಹನ ಆತಿಥ್ಯ. ಸಜ್ಜನರ ಪಾಲಿಗೆ, ಅಲ್ಲಾಹನ ಬಳಿ ಏನಿದೆಯೋ ಅದುವೇ ಉತ್ತಮ.

02/10/2015, 9:02 am - Abhilash: ಹೀಗೆ ಬದುಕಿದ್ದರು ನಮ್ಮ ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿ.
 (ತಪ್ಪದೆ ಈ ಸಂದೇಶ ಶೇರ್ ಮಾಡಿ)

ಎರಡು ಘಂಟೆ ಯುದ್ಧ ಮುಂದುವರಿದಿದ್ದರೆ,ಭಾರತೀಯ ಸೇನೆ ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನದ ಲಾಹೋರ್ ತನಕ ತನ್ನ ಅಧಿಪತ್ಯವನ್ನು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿಸುತ್ತಿತ್ತು.

ಎಚ್ಚೆತ್ತ ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನ ಅಮೇರಿಕದ ಮುಂದೆ ಮಂಡಿಯೂರಿ ಕೂತಿತು.ಯುದ್ಧವನ್ನು ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸಲು ಭಾರತಕ್ಕೆ ಸೂಚಿಸುವಂತೇ ಗೋಗರೆಯಿತು.

ಆಗ ಅಮೇರಿಕದ ಗೋಧಿ ಭಾರತಕ್ಕೆ ಆಮದಾಗುತ್ತಿತ್ತು.ಆ ಗೋಧಿಯ ಗುಣಮಟ್ಟ ಹೇಗಿತ್ತೆಂದರೆ,ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳು ತಿನ್ನಲೂ ಅಸಾಧ್ಯವಾದದ್ದು.ಈ ಆಮದು ಒಪ್ಪಂದಕ್ಕೆ ಸಹಿ ಹಾಕಿದ್ದು ಜವಾಹರಲಾಲ್ ನೆಹರೂ.ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನದ ಜೊತೆಗಿನ ಯುದ್ಧವನ್ನು ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸದಿದ್ದರೆ,ಗೋಧಿಯ ರಫ್ತನ್ನು ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸುತ್ತೇವೆಂಬ ಸೂಚನೆ ಅಮೇರಿಕದಿಂದ ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿಯವರಿಗೆ ಬಂತು.ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿಯವರಿಂದ ಬಂದ ಉತ್ತರ, “ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸಿ ತೊಂದರೆಯಿಲ್ಲ”

 “ಹೊಟ್ಟೆಗೆ ಆಹಾರವಿಲ್ಲದಿದ್ದರೆ ಭಾರತೀಯರು ಸಾಯುತ್ತಾರೆ”ಅಮೇರಿಕದ ಕುಚೋದ್ಯ ಪ್ರತಿಕ್ರಿಯೆ..!!

“ದೊಡ್ಡು ಕೊಟ್ಟು ನಿಮ್ಮ ಕಳಪೆಗುಣಮಟ್ಟದ ಗೋಧಿಯನ್ನು ತಿಂದು ಆರೋಗ್ಯ ಕೆಡಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದಕ್ಕಿಂತ,ಹಸಿವಿನಿಂದ ಸಾಯುವುದೇ ವಾಸಿ.ಇಂದಿನಿಂದ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಗೋಧಿ ನಮಗೆ ಬೇಕಿಲ್ಲ” ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿಯವರ ತೀಕ್ಷ್ಣ ಪ್ರತಿಕ್ರಿಯೆ.

ದೆಹಲಿಯ ರಾಮಲೀಲಾ ಮೈದಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ದೇಶದ ಜನತೆಯನ್ನುದ್ದೇಶಿಸಿ ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿ ಮಾತನಾಡುತ್ತಾರೆ..

“ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನದೊಂದಿಗೆ ಯುದ್ಧ ನಡೆಯುತ್ತಿದೆ.ಅಮೇರಿಕದಿಂದ ಗೋಧಿ ಆಮದಾಗುವುದು ನಿಂತಿದೆ.ದೇಶದ ಜನ ಸಹಕರಿಸಬೇಕಿದೆ.ಒಂದು..ನೀವು ನೇರವಾಗಿ ಸೇನೆಗೆ ಧನ ಅಥವಾ ಆಹಾರದ ಸಹಾಯವನ್ನು ಮಾಡಬಹುದು.ಎರಡು..ಪ್ರತಿ ಸೋಮವಾರ ನೀವು ಉಪವಾಸವೃತವನ್ನು ಆಚರಿಸಬಹುದು.ಇದರಿಂದ ದೇಶದ ಹಣಕಾಸಿನ ವ್ಯವಹಾರ ಸರಾಗವಾಗಿ ನಡೆಯಬಹುದು.ಇಲ್ಲದಿದ್ದರೆ ದೇಶ ಆರ್ಥಿಕ ಸಂಕಷ್ಟಗಳನ್ನು ಎದುರಿಸಬೇಕಾಗಬಹುದು”

ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿಯವರ ಈ ಕರೆಗೆ ಇಡೀ ದೇಶ ಓಗೊಟ್ಟಿತು.ಹಲವರು ಸೇನೆಗೆ ಸಹಾಯ ಮಾಡಿದರು.ಲಕ್ಷಾಂತರ ಜನ ಸೋಮವಾರದ ಉಪವಾಸವನ್ನು ಆರಂಭಿಸಿದರು.ಸ್ವತಃ ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿಯವರೂ ಸೋಮವಾರದಂದು ಉಪವಾಸವೃತವನ್ನು ಕೈಗೊಂಡರು.

ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿಯವರ ಪತ್ನಿ,ಲಲಿತಾದೇವಿಯವರು ಅನಾರೋಗ್ಯಪೀಡಿತರಾಗಿದ್ದರು.ಮನೆಗೆಲಸಕ್ಕೆಂದು ಕೆಲಸದವಳೊಬ್ಬಳು ಬರುತ್ತಿದ್ದಳು.ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿಯವರು ಮಹಿಳೆಗೆ ನಾಳೆಯಿಂದ ಕೆಲಸಕ್ಕೆ ಬರಬೇಡ ಎಂದರು.ಆಕೆ”ಅಲ್ಲ,ನಿಮ್ಮ ಬಟ್ಟೆಯನ್ನು ತೊಳೆಯುವುದು,ಮನೆಯನ್ನು ಸ್ವಚ್ಛಗೊಳಿಸುವುದು,ನಿಮ್ಮ ಪತ್ನಿಯ ಆರೈಕೆಯನ್ನು ಯಾರು ಮಾಡಿಕೊಡುತ್ತಾರೆ ಸ್ವಾಮೀ”ಎಂದು ಕೇಳಿದಳು.

“ದೇಶಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಇದು ಅನಿವಾರ್ಯವಮ್ಮಾ.ನಿನಗೆ ಕೊಡುವ ಸಂಬಳದ ಹಣವಾದರೂ ಉಳಿದೀತು.ದೇಶದ ಒಳಿತಿಗಾದೀತು” ಎಂದು ಹೇಳಿದರು.ನಂತರ ಮನೆಯ ಪ್ರತಿಯೊಂದು ಕೆಲಸವನ್ನೂ ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿಯವರೇ ನಿಭಾಯಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದರು.

ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿಯವರ ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಗೆ ಇಂಗ್ಲೀಷ್ ಹೇಳಿಕೊಡಲೆಂದು ಟ್ಯೂಟರ್ ಬರುತ್ತಿದ್ದರು.ಅವರನ್ನೂ ಕೆಲಸದಿಂದ ವಿಮುಕ್ತಗೊಳಿಸಿದರು.”ಮಕ್ಕಳು ಇಂಗ್ಲೀಷಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಫೇಲಾಗುತ್ತಾರೆ”ಟ್ಯೂಟರ್ ಹೇಳಿದ್ದಕ್ಕೆ ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿ,”ಆಗಲಿ ಬಿಡಿ ಇಂಗ್ಲೀಷ್ ನಮ್ಮ ಭಾಷೆಯಲ್ಲ.ಇಂಗ್ಲಿಷರು ಹಿಂದಿಯನ್ನು ಬರೆದರೆ ಅವರೂ ಫೇಲಾಗುತ್ತಾರೆ”ಎಂದರು.

ಒಂದು ದಿನ ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿಯವರ ಪತ್ನಿ,ಹರಿದುಹೋಗಿರುವ ಅವರ ಧೋತಿಯನ್ನು ನೋಡಿ “ಒಂದು ಹೊಸ ಧೋತಿಯನ್ನಾದರೂ ತೆಗೆದುಕೊಳ್ಳಬಾರದೇ?”ಎಂದು ಕೇಳುತ್ತಾರೆ.”ಅದನ್ನು ಕೊಳ್ಳಲು ಹಣವೆಲ್ಲಿದೆ..?ಬರುವ ಸಂಬಳವನ್ನೂ ಬಿಟ್ಟಾಗಿದೆ.ಮನೆಯ ಖರ್ಚುಗಳನ್ನು ಕಡಿಮೆ ಮಾಡು” ಎಂದಿದ್ದರು.

ಅಕ್ಟೋಬರ್ ಎರಡು ಬರುತ್ತಿದೆ.ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿಯವರ ಜನ್ಮದಿನ.ನಿರ್ಲಕ್ಷ್ಯಕ್ಕೊಳಗಾಗಿರುವ ಸರಳ,ಸಜ್ಜನ ಮಹಾಪುರುಷನನ್ನು ನಾವಂದು ಸ್ಮರಿಸಬೇಕಿದೆ.. Forward this guys  be proud about shastriji

07/10/2015, 9:44 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: ಬದಲಾಗದ ಹಣೆಬರಹ

ಒಂದು ದಿನ ಯಮಧರ್ಮ ಒಬ್ಬ ಹುಡುಗನ ಬಳಿ ಬಂದು ನುಡಿಯುತ್ತಾನೆ "ಮಾನವ, ಇವತ್ತು ನಿನ್ನ ಕೊನೆಯ ದಿನ"

ಹುಡುಗ: ಇಲ್ಲಾಗುರು ನಾನಿನ್ನು ಸಾಯೋಕೆ ರೆಡಿ ಆಗಿಲ್ಲಾ. ಇನ್ನು ಬೇಜಾನ್ ಕೆಲ್ಸ ಇದೆ ನಂಗೆ.

ಯಮಧರ್ಮ: ಆದರೆ ವಿಧಿಬರಹ ಹಾಗಿದೆ. ನಿನ್ನ ಹೆಸರೆ ಇವತ್ತು ಲಿಸ್ಟನಲ್ಲಿ ಮೊದಲಿದೆ.

ಹುಡುಗ: ಓಹ್, ಹೌದಾ? ಆಯ್ತು. ಒಂದ್ ನಿಮಿಷ ಕೂತ್ಕೊ. ಇಬ್ರೂ ಒಂದ್ ಕಾಫೀ ಕುಡ್ಕೋಂಡ್ ಹೋಗೋಣ.

ಯಮಧರ್ಮ: ಸರಿ ಹಾಗೇ ಆಗಲಿ. ಹುಡುಗ ಯಮಧರ್ಮನಿಗೆ ಕಾಫೀಯೊಳಗೆ ನಿದ್ದೆ ಮಾತ್ರೆ ಬೆರೆಸಿ ಕೊಡ್ತಾನೆ. ಯಮರಾಜ ಕಾಫೀ ಕುಡಿದು ಗಡದ್ದಾಗಿ ನಿದ್ದೆ ಮಾಡಿಬಿಡ್ತಾನೆ. 

ಹುಡುಗ ಯಮಧರ್ಮನ ಡೆತ್ ಲಿಸ್ಟ್ ತೊಗೊಂಡು ಮೊದಲಿದ್ದ ತನ್ನ ಹೆಸರನ್ನು ಅಳಿಸಿ ಕೊನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಬರೆದುಬಿಡುತ್ತಾನೆ. 

ಯಮಧರ್ಮ ನಿದ್ದೆಯಿಂದ್ದೆದು ಹುಡುಗನಿಗೆ ಹೇಳ್ತಾನೆ: ನೀ ಕೊಟ್ಟ ಕಾಫೀ ಅದ್ಭುತವಾಗಿತ್ತು. ಹಾಗಾಗಿ ನಿನಗೆ ಒಂದು ರಿಯಾಯಿತಿ ಕೊಡ್ತೀನಿ. ಇವತ್ತು ನನ್ನ ಕೆಲಸವನ್ನು ಲಿಸ್ಟನ ಕೊನೆಯಿಂದ ಶುರುಮಾಡಲು ತೀರ್ಮಾನಿಸಿದ್ದೇನೆ.

ಹಣೆಬರಹ ಏನ್ ಮಾಡಿದ್ರೂ ಬದಲಾಗಲ್ಲ ಗುರೂ.

08/10/2015, 9:27 pm - Bhavan Play: A store that sells “New Husbands” has opened in New York City, where a woman may go to choose a husband.
 
There are six floors and the value of the products increases as the shopper ascends the floors..

A woman goes to find a husband.

Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs.

She continues to the second floor..

Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs ...n love kids..

she continues upward...

Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking..

'Wow,' she thinks, but She goes to the fourth floor..

Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Good Looking and Help with Housework.

She exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!' Still, she goes to the fifth floor...

Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are very handsome, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic nature.. 

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:

Floor 6 - You are visitor number 31,456,012 to this floor...

There are no men on this floor. This floor exists only as proof that women are impossible to please!!! 
Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store..😜😝
 (scroll and keep reading!) 


Now The store's owner opened a “New Wives Store” just across the street..

The 1st Floor has wives that listen to men..

15/10/2015, 7:01 am - Hrushikesh: It was a crowded flight and a beautiful lady aged around 40 years boarded the flight as the passenger. She searched for her seat and found her seat was next to a black man.

She showed that she wasn’t in a hurry to take her seat as she found it too hard and awkward to sit next to a black man.

Feeling disgusted, the beautiful lady called the air hostess and asked her to change her seat.

The air hostess requested for a reason why she would like to change the seat.
She replied, “It is impossible for me to sit next to a black man, I hate it! 

The air hostess was shocked to hear these hard words from the one who looked so dignified and composed.
She again demanded her to get her a new seat. The airhostess said she would do so and requested her to wait for a few minutes. 

The air hostess went in search of an empty seat for the lady. The air hostess told the lady, ‘I’m afraid Madam, there is no vacant seat in the economy class and the flight is almost full! However, we do follow the policy to fulfil the desires of our passengers to the maximum extent possible. So, give me a minute, I will check with my captain and get back to you, as we feel it is not fair to force a passenger to have an unpleasant seat!’

The lady waited for a couple of minutes and the air hostess came.

The latter replied, ‘Madam, sorry for this inconvenience. We don’t want to make your journey unpleasant by making you sit next to someone with whom you aren’t comfortable. There is one seat available in the First Class. Although we don’t allow any passenger to move from economy class to first class, to make you a happy customer, we are doing this for the first time in our company’s history. Our captain agreed to shift from economy class to first class.!’

Just before the lady said any word as a reply, the air hostess humbly requested the black man and told him, ‘Dear sir, would you please shift your seat to first class? Please retrieve all your personal items from your seat and our captain would like to move you to first class as we don’t really want you to have an uncomfortable journey sitting next an unpleasant person, with an ugly mind!‘

The lady was quiet and frozen! A few of the fellow passengers were happy and gave huge applause for the flight crew!

Kindly read this awesome story - its little lengthy but truly touching.
Also like to request you  to Fwd to all right-thinking people who detest discrimination based on colour, race, caste and religion.

16/10/2015, 2:16 pm - Abhilash: A woman went to a pet shop and immediately spotted a large, beautiful parrot.

There was a sign on the cage that said Rs.250.

"Why so little?" she asked the pet store owner.

The owner looked at her and said, "Look, I should tell you first that this bird used to live in a house of prostitution, and sometimes it says some pretty vulgar stuff."

The woman thought about this, but decided she had to have the bird anyway. She tookit home and hung the bird's cage up in her living room and waited for it to say something.

The bird looked around the room, then at her, and said,"New house, new madam."

The woman was a bit shocked at the implication, but then thought "that's really not so bad."

When her two teenage daughters returned from school, the bird saw them and said,"New house, new madam, new girls."

The girls and the woman were a bit offended but then began to laugh about the situation considering how and where the parrot had been raised.

Moments later, the woman's husband Ketan came home from work.

The bird looked at him and said, "Hi Ketan."

... AND THEN THE FIGHT STARTED !!

Man on phone: Honey I've been asked to go fishing  with my boss for 2 days...30- 31st.  This is a good opportunity for me to get the promotion. So, could you please pack enough clothes for 2 days, set out my rod & fishing box. We're leaving from office & I'll swing by the house to pick my things. Oh, Please pack my new blue silk pajamas !


The wife thinks this sounds a bit fishy but being a good wife she did exactly as her husband said

The husband came home on 1st jan even a little tired but looking good.

The wife welcomed him & asked if he caught any fish ?

He said "Yes, Lots of Salmon, Blue gill & a few Swordfish. But why didn't u pack my blue silk pajamas ?"

You'll love the answer..!!


She says,
"I did.. They're in your fishing box!!!!!!!!

Game over👏🔫

BITCH Was a FEMALE DOG

DICK Was a NAME of a cartoon film,

BANG Was a SOUND

RUBBER Was Nothin But an ERASER

ASS Was An ANIMAL

COCK was a male bird

SCREW was Just a Fixing TOOL

HEAD Meant a Part of BODY

BALLS Meant a Round TOY

& then....

I met you all, my friends,....

My wonderful girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married.

There was only one little thing bothering me...It was her beautiful younger sister.

One day her sister asked me to come at home, She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome. She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married.

Well, I was in total shock, and couldn't say a word.

She said, 'I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.'

I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door. I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car.

Lord... And behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!

With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me and said, 'We are very happy that you have passed our   test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter.

Welcome to the family.'

And the moral of this story is:



"Always keep your condoms in your car...
26/10/2015, 5:38 pm - Theja: A nice quote-
I had a sparrow as a pet but it flew away one day...
Then I had a squirrel but it ran away too..
Then...I planted a tree and they both came back....😊

- Dr APJ Abdul Kalam


A very nice quote-
I had soda but a friend drank it & went away

I had papad but a friend ate it & went away

Then I got a bottle of daaru and both my friends came back & brought more soda & papad.. 

.. 😎😂😂

28/10/2015, 12:33 pm - Anni jss: One day an ✈aeroplane cleaner was cleaning the pilots’ cockpit when he saw a 📕book entitled “How to fly an aeroplane✈ for beginners. Volume One”. 
😊

He opened the first page which said, “To start the engine, press the 🔴red button.”.  He did so and the airplane engine started.

He was happy and opened the next page. “To set airplane moving press the blue🔵 button.”

He did so and the ✈aeroplane started moving at an amazing speed.

He wanted to fly so he opened the third page which read, “To let the aeroplane fly, please press the ♻green button.”

He did this and the plane started to ✈✈✈fly. 
He was excited!!!!!!

After 20 minutes of flying, he was satisfied and wanted to land so he decided to go to the fourth page.

He fainted 😱after reading the instructions…….

The fourth page read, “To learn how to land, please purchase Volume Two at the nearest bookshop!!!!😱😱😱😱😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

31/10/2015, 1:13 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: ಬ್ರಾಹ್ಮಣರ ಭೋಜನದ ಕ್ರಿಯಾವಿಧಾನದ ಹಂತಗಳು

ಪ್ರೋಕ್ಷಣೆ : ಯಜ್ಞಾರಂಭದಲ್ಲಿ ಯಜ್ಞಸಾಮಗ್ರಿಗಳನ್ನು ಪವಿತ್ರೀಕರಿಸುವಂತೆ ಇಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಭೋಜನಥಾಲಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಬಡಿಸಿದ ಅನ್ನಾದಿ ಖಾದ್ಯಗಳನ್ನು ಪವಿತ್ರೀಕರಿಸುವುದಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಅನ್ನಬ್ರಹ್ಮನಿಗೆ ನಮಸ್ಕರಿಸಿ ಪ್ರಣವ (ಓಂ) ಮತ್ತು ವ್ಯಾಹೃತಿಪೂರ್ವಕವಾದ ಗಾಯತ್ರಿಮಂತ್ರದಿಂದ ಮತ್ತು ಸ್ವಾದೋಪಿತೋ ಮಧುಪಿತೋ ಮಯಂತ್ವಾವವ್ಯಮಹೇ ಅಸ್ಮಾಕಮವಿತಾಭವ' ಎಂಬ ಮಂತ್ರದಿಂದಲೂ ಅನ್ನದ ಮೇಲೆ ಜಲಪ್ರೋಕ್ಷಣೆ ಮಾಡಬೇಕು.

ಪರಿಸಿಂಚನ : ನಮ್ಮ ಆಡುನುಡಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಬಹಳ ಸರಳವಾಗಿ ನಾವಿದನ್ನು ಸುತ್ತುಗಟ್ಟುವುದು ಎನ್ನುತ್ತೇವೆ. ಏನನ್ನು ಸುತ್ತುಗಟ್ಟುವುದು ಮತ್ತು ಯಾಕಾಗಿ ಸುತ್ತುಗಟ್ಟುವುದು ಎಂಬ ಅರಿವಿಲ್ಲದೆ ನಡೆಸುವ ಈ ಕ್ರಿಯೆ ಬ್ರಾಹ್ಮಣರು ಸುತ್ತುಗಟ್ಟದೆ ಉಣ್ಣುವುದಿಲ್ಲ ಎಂಬಷ್ಟರ ಮಟ್ಟಿಗೆ ಯಾಂತ್ರಿಕವಾಗಿಯೇ ಉಳಿದಿದೆ. ಸೇಚನ, ಸಿಂಚನ ಎಂಬ ಶಬ್ದಗಳು ನೀರನ್ನು ಚಿಮುಕಿಸುವ ಕ್ರಿಯೆಯನ್ನು ಸೂಚಿಸುವಂತಹವುಗಳು. ಈ ಮೊದಲೇ ಜಲಪ್ರೋಕ್ಷಣೆಗೊಂಡು ಶುದ್ಧೀಕರಿಸಿದ ಭೋಜನಥಾಲಿ ಅಥವಾ ಪತ್ರಾವಳಿಯೋ, ಬಾಳೆ ಎಲೆಯ ಮೇಲೊ ಬಡಿಸಿದ ಅನ್ನದ ಸುತ್ತ ಎಡದಿಂದ ಬಲಕ್ಕೆ ಪ್ರದಕ್ಷಿಣಾಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಅಭಿಮಂತ್ರಿತ ಜಲವನ್ನು 'ಸತ್ಯಂತ್ವರ್ತೇನ ಪರಿಷಿಂಚಾಮಿ' ಎಂದು ಉಚ್ಚರಿಸುತ್ತ ಪರಿಸಿಂಚನ ಮಾಡಬೇಕು. ಇದರರ್ಥ 'ಸತ್ಯ' (ಭಗವಂತ) ಮತ್ತು 'ಋತ' (ಧರ್ಮ ಮತ್ತು ನ್ಯಾಯ)ವನ್ನು ಸ್ಮರಿಸಿ ಈ ಅನ್ನವನ್ನು ಪರಿಷೇಚನ ಮಾಡುತ್ತೇನೆ. ನಾನು ತಿನ್ನುವ ಈ ಅನ್ನಕ್ಕೆ ಪರಮಾತ್ಮನ ಮತ್ತು ಸತ್ಯಧರ್ಮಗಳ ರಕ್ಷೆಯಿದೆ. ಈ ಪರಿಸಿಂಚನವೆಂಬ ಕ್ರಿಯೆ ನಾನು ಈ ಅನ್ನವನ್ನು ಸತ್ಯ ಮತ್ತು ಧರ್ಮಗಳ ನೆಲೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಭಗವಂತನ ಕೃಪೆಯಿಂದ ಗಳಿಸಿದ್ದೇನೆ ಎಂಬ ಘೋಷಣೆಯೂ ಹೌದು.

ಚಿತ್ರಾಹುತಿ : ಎಲೆಯ ಬಲತುದಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ನೀರಿನಿಂದ ಗೆರೆಯೆಳೆದು ಮೂರು ಅಥವಾ ಐದು ಅನ್ನದ ಸಣ್ಣ ತುತ್ತುಗಳನ್ನಿರಿಸುವುದೇ ಚಿತ್ರಾಹುತಿ. ಈ ಚಿತ್ರಾಹುತಿಯನ್ನು ನೀಡುವಾಗ 'ಅಂತಶ್ಚರತಿ ಭೂತೇಷು ಗುಹಾಯಾಂ ವಿಶ್ವತೋಮುಖಃ | ತ್ವಂ ಯಜ್ಞಂ ತ್ವಂ ವಷಟ್ಕಾರಃ ತ್ವಂ ವಿಷ್ಣುಃ ಪುರುಷಃಪರಃ ||ಎಂದು ಹೇಳಬೇಕು. ಈ ವಿಶ್ವವನ್ನು ಎಲ್ಲಕಡೆಯಿಂದಲೂ ಅವಲೋಕಿಸಬಲ್ಲ ನೀನು ಈ ಯಜ್ಞದ ಮಂತ್ರಸ್ವರೂಪ ಮತ್ತು ಯಜ್ಞವೂ ಹೌದು. ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಭೂಪತಿ, ಭುವನಪತಿ ಮತ್ತು ಭೂತಪತಿಗಳೆಂದು ಮೂರು ಆಹುತಿಗಳನ್ನು ನೀಡುವ ಕ್ರಮಕ್ಕೆ ಬಲಿತ್ರಯವೆಂದೂ, ಚಿತ್ರ, ಚಿತ್ರಗುಪ್ತ, ಯಮ, ಧರ್ಮರಾಜ (ಯಮದೂತ) ಮತ್ತು ಸರ್ವಭೂತಗಳಿಗಾಗಿ ಐದು ಆಹುತಿಗಳನ್ನು ಇಡುವ ಕ್ರಮಕ್ಕೆ ಚಿತ್ರಾಹುತಿ ಅಥವಾ ಬಲಿಪಂಚಕವೆಂದು ಕರೆಯಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಈ ಮೊದಲೇ ತಿಳಿಸಿದಂತೆ ಭೋಜನವೂ ಒಂದು ಯಜ್ಞವಿಧಿಯಂತೆ ಇದ್ದು, ಯಜ್ಞಕರ್ಮದಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರಧಾನಹೋಮ ಅಥವಾ ಪೂರ್ಣಾಹುತಿಗೆ ಮೊದಲು ಉಪದೇವತೆಗಳಿಗೆ ನೀಡುವ ಬಲಿಯ ಪ್ರತೀಕದಂತೆ ಈ ಚಿತ್ರಾಹುತಿ ಅಥವಾ ಬಲಿತ್ರಯಗಳು. ಈ ಆಹುತಿಗಳನ್ನು ನೀಡಿದ ನಂತರ ಬೆರಳನ್ನು ತೊಳೆಯುವ ಪದ್ಧತಿಯಿದೆ. ಈ ರೀತಿ ಚಿತ್ರಾಹುತಿಗಳನ್ನು ನೀಡಿದ ಬಳಿಕ ಎಡಗೈನ ಹೆಬ್ಬೆರಳು, ಮಧ್ಯಮ ಮತ್ತು ತೋರುಬೆರಳುಗಳಿಂದ ಭೋಜನ ಪಾತ್ರವನ್ನು ಸ್ಪರ್ಶಿಸಿ 'ಅನ್ನಂ ಬ್ರಹ್ಮಾ ರಸೋವಿಷ್ಣುಃ ಭುಂಕ್ತಾದೇವೊ ಮಹೇಶ್ವರಃ | ಪ್ರಿಯತಾಂ ಭಗವಾನೀಶಃ ಪರಮಾತ್ಮಾ ಸದಾಶಿವಃ || ( ಈ ಅನ್ನವೇ ಬ್ರಹ್ಮ, ಇದರ ರಸವೇ ವಿಷ್ಣು, ಇದನ್ನು ಸ್ವೀಕರಿಸುವವನೇ ಪರಮೇಶ್ವರ. ನಮಗೆ ಮಂಗಳವನ್ನು ನೀಡುವ ಪರಮದೇವನಿಗೆ ಈ ಪ್ರಾಣಾಗ್ನಿಹೋತ್ರ (ಭೋಜನ) ಪ್ರಿಯವಾಗಲಿಎಂದರ್ಥ.

ಆಪೋಷನ : 'ಆಪೋಷನ'ವೆಂದರೆ ನೀರನ್ನು ಗುಟುಕಿಸುವುದು ಎಂದರ್ಥ. ನೀರು ನಮಗೆ ಬದುಕನ್ನು ನೀಡುವಂತಹದು. ಅದು ಅಮೃತ ಸಮಾನ. ಹಾಗಾಗಿ ನಾವು ತಿನ್ನುವ ಈ ಅನ್ನಕ್ಕೆ ಅಮೃತದ ಸವಿಯಿರಲಿ ಎಂಬ ಸಂಕಲ್ಪದೊಂದಿಗೆ 'ಅಮೃತೋಸ್ತು, ಅಮೃತೋಪರಣಮಸೀ ಸ್ವಾಹಾಃ' ಎಂದು ಆಪೋಷನಗೈಯ್ಯಬೇಕು.

ಅಭಿಘಾರ : ಅಭಿಘಾರವೆಂದರೆ ನೈವೇದ್ಯಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಹಾಕುವ ತುಪ್ಪ. ಇದು ಆಹಾರವನ್ನು ಸ್ವಾದಿಷ್ಠವಾಗಿ ಮಾಡುತ್ತದೆ. ಯಜ್ಞದಲ್ಲಿ ಹವಿಸ್ಸಿನ ಮೇಲೆ ತುಪ್ಪವನ್ನು ಹನಿಸುವಂತೆ ಈ ಭೋಜನ ಯಜ್ಞದಲ್ಲಿ ಈ ಅಭಿಘಾರ.

ಸ್ವಾಹಾಕಾರ : ಯಜ್ಞಯಾಗಾದಿಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಪೂರ್ಣಾಹುತಿಗೆ ಮೊದಲು ಅಗ್ನಿಗೆ ಚರುವನ್ನು ಸಮರ್ಪಿಸಿದಂತೆ ಪ್ರಾಣ, ಅಪಾನ,ವ್ಯಾನ, ಉದಾನ, ಸಮಾನ ಮತ್ತು ಬ್ರಹ್ಮನಿಗೂ ಎಲೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಬಡಿಸಿದ ಖಾರ, ಉಪ್ಪು, ಹುಳಿಗಳನ್ನು ಸೇರಿಸದ ಅನ್ನದ ಸಣ್ಣ ಕಬಳ (ಸಣ್ಣ ತುತ್ತು) ಗಳನ್ನು ಸ್ವಾಹಾಕಾರಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಭುಂಜಿಸಬೇಕು.ಈ ಸ್ವಾಹಾಕಾರವೆಂದರೆ ಜಗಿಯದೆ ನುಂಗುವ ಪ್ರಕ್ರಿಯೆ. ಈ ಪ್ರಾಣಾದಿ ಸ್ವಾಹಾಕಾರ ಪ್ರಕ್ರಿಯೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರಾಣಾಯ ಸ್ವಾಹಾಕ್ಕೆ ತೊರು ಬೆರಳು ಮತ್ತು ಮಧ್ಯದ ಬೆರಳು ಮತ್ತು ಹೆಬ್ಬೆರಳು, ಅಪಾನಾಯ ಸ್ವಾಹಾಗೆ ಮಧ್ಯದ ಬೆರಳು, ಉಂಗುರ ಬೆರಳು ಮತ್ತು ಹೆಬ್ಬೆರಳು, ವ್ಯಾನಾಯ ಸ್ವಾಹಾಗೆ ಉಂಗುರದ ಬೆರಳು, ಕಿರು ಬೆರಳು ಮತ್ತು ಹೆಬ್ಬೆರಳು, ಉದಾನಾಯ ಸ್ವಾಹಾಗೆ ಮಧ್ಯದ ಬೆರಳು, ಉಂಗುರದ ಬೆರಳು ಮತ್ತು ಹೆಬ್ಬೆರಳು, ಸಮಾನ ಮತ್ತು ಬ್ರಹ್ಮಕ್ಕೆ ಐದೂ ಬೆರಳುಗಳನ್ನು ಬಳಸಬೇಕೆಂಬ ನಿಯಮವಿದೆ.

ಈ ಎಲ್ಲ ಪೂರ್ವ ಪೀಠಿಕೆಯ ನಂತರ ಭೋಜನವನ್ನು ಆತುರ, ಅಸಹನೆ, ಸಿಟ್ಟು ಸೆಡವುಗಳಿಲ್ಲದೆ ಶಾಂತಮನಸ್ಸಿನಿಂದ ತನಗೆ ಬೇಕಾದಷ್ಟು ಸ್ವೀಕರಿಸಬೇಕು. ಅತಿ ಭುಂಜನವು ದೈಹಿಕ ಆರೋಗ್ಯದ ಮೇಲೆ ವಿಕೃತ ಪರಿಣಾಮವನ್ನು ಬಿರಬಲ್ಲದೆಂಬ ಎಚ್ಚರವಿರಬೇಕು. ಈ ರೀತಿಯ ಭೋಜನವೇ ಪ್ರಾಣಾಗ್ನಿಹೋತ್ರದ ಪೂರ್ಣಾಹುತಿ.

ಉತ್ತರಾಪೋಶನ : ಉತ್ತರಾಪೋಶನವೆಂದರೆ ಭೋಜನದ ಅಂತ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ನೀರು ಕುಡಿಯುವುದು. ಯಜ್ಞದಲ್ಲಿ ಪೂರ್ಣಾಹುತಿ ನಂತರ ವಸೋರ್ಧಾರೆ ಎಂಬ ಹೆಸರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಹವಿಸ್ಸಿನ ಮೇಲೆ ಆವರಣವಾಗುವ ಹಾಗೆ ತುಪ್ಪದ ಧಾರೆಯನ್ನು ಹರಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಅದೇ ರೀತಿ ಈ ಭೋಜನ ಯಜ್ಞದ ನಂತರ ಈ ಉತ್ತರಾಪೋಶನವು ನಾವು ಭುಂಜಿಸಿದ ಭೋಜನವನ್ನು ಅಮೃತವನ್ನಾಗಿಸಲಿ ಎಂಬ ಆಶಯದೊಂದಿಗೆ 'ಅಮೃತಾ ಪಿಧಾನಮಸಿ ಸ್ವಾಹಾ' ಎನ್ನುತ್ತ ಆಪೋಷನವನ್ನು ಮಾಡಬೇಕು. ಪಿಧಾನವೆಂದರೆ ಮುಚ್ಚಳವೆಂತಲೂ ಅಮೃತ ಪಿಧಾನವೆಂದರೆ ಅಮೃತದ ಆವರಣವೆಂತಲೂ ಅರ್ಥ. ಈ ಆಪೋಶನದಲ್ಲಿ ಭೋಜನದ ಮೇಲೆ ಅಮೃತದ ಅವರಣವಾಗಲಿ ಎಂಬ ಆಶಯವಿದೆ. ಪೂರ್ವಾಪೋಶನವು ಭೋಜನಕ್ಕೆ ಅಮೃತದ ವೇದಿಕೆಯಾದರೆ ಉತ್ತರಾಪೋಶನವು ಭೋಜನಕ್ಕೆ ಇರಿಸುವ ಅಮೃತದ ಮುಚ್ಚಳವಾಗಿದೆ. ಹೀಗೆ ಪೂರ್ವಾಪೋಶನ ಮತ್ತು ಉತ್ತರಾಪೋಶನವೆಂಬ ಎರಡು ಅಮೃತಸ್ತರಗಳ ನಡುವೆ ನಾವು ಭುಂಜಿಸಿದ ಭೋಜನ ಅಮೃತಮಯವಾಗಲಿ ಎಂಬ ಹಾರೈಕೆ ಇಲ್ಲಿಯದು. ವಸೋರ್ಧಾರೆಯು ಹವಿಸ್ಸನ್ನು ಪೂರ್ಣವಾಗಿ ಪಚನ ಮಾಡಲು ಯಜ್ಞಾಗ್ನಿಗೆ ಸಹಾಯಕವಾಗುವಂತೆ ಉತ್ತರಾಪೋಶನವು ನಾವು ಸೇವಿಸಿದ ಭೋಜನವನ್ನು ಪಚನ ಮಾಡಲು ಜಠರಾಗ್ನಿಗೆ ನೆರವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ

ಉದಕದಾನ : ಉತ್ತರಾಪೋಶನದಲ್ಲಿ ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ನೀರನ್ನು ಕುಡಿದು ಉಳಿದುದನ್ನು ಉಂಡ ಎಲೆಯ ಎಡತುದಿಗೆ ಬಿಡುತ್ತಾ 'ರೌರವೇ ಪೂಯನಿಲಯೇ ಪದ್ಮಾರ್ಬುದ ನಿವಾಸಿನಾಂ | ಅರ್ಥಿನಾಂ ಉದಕಂ ದತ್ತಂ ಅಕ್ಷಯ್ಯಮುಪತಿಷ್ಠತು|| ಅಂದರೆ ರೌರವಾದಿ ನರಕದ ಕೋಟ್ಯಾನುಕೋಟಿ ನಿವಾಸಿಗಳು ನೀರಿಗಾಗಿ ಪರಿತಪಿಸುತ್ತಿರುವಾಗ ಈ ನೀರನ್ನು ಕೊಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇನೆ. ಇದು ಅಕ್ಷಯವಾಗಲಿ. (ಪೂಯ=ಕೀವು ಪೂಯನಿಲಯ = ನರಕ ) ಈ ಉದಕದಾನವೆಂಬುದು ಮಾನಸಿಕ ಸಂಸ್ಕಾರ. ದಾನ ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರತಿಗೃಹದ ಮೂಲ ಛಾಯೆಯನ್ನು ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಕಾಣಬಹುದು

01/11/2015, 6:58 pm - Theja: A German once visited a temple under
construction where he saw a sculptor making an idol of God...

Suddenly he noticed a similar idol lying nearby...
Surprised, he asked the sculptor, "Do you
need two statues of the same idol?"
"No," said the sculptor
without looking up, "We need only one, but the first one got damaged at the last stage..."

The gentleman
examined the idol and found no apparent damage...

"Where is the damage?" he asked.
"There is a scratch on the nose of the idol." said the sculptor, still
busy with his work....

"Where are you going to install the idol?"

The sculptor replied that it would be
installed on a
pillar twenty feet high...

"If the idol is that far who is going to know that there is a scratch on the nose?"
the gentleman asked.

The sculptor stopped work, looked up at the gentleman, smiled and said,

"I will know it..."

The desire to excel is exclusive of the fact whether someone else appreciates it or not....

"Excellence" is a
drive from inside, not outside....

Excellence is not for
someone else to notice but for your own satisfaction and efficiency.

Don't Climb a Mountain with an Intention that the World Should See You,
Climb the Mountain with the Intention to See the World

He looks to his left & notices that  there is a spare seat betwen himself & the next guy.

MAN: "who would ever miss the FIFA world cup final?"

GUY: "that was my wife's seat. 
We have been to the last five world cup finals together, 
but sadly she passed away."

MAN: "oh... that's terrible, and very sweet of you to have her here symbolically by having a vacant seat .. ..
but these are expensive tickets;  couldn't you have brought another family member, friend or someone else with you?"

GUY: "no...
they are all at her funeral!"

Men will be men....😂

ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆ: ಗಾಂಧೀಜಿ, ವಲ್ಲಭಭಾಯಿ ಪಟೇಲ್ ಮುಂತಾದವರ ಜಯಂತಿಗಳನ್ನು ಆಚರಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಆದರೆ ಇಂದಿರಾ, ರಾಜೀವರ ಪುಣ್ಯ ತಿಥಿಗಳನ್ನು ಆಚರಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಹಾಗೇಕೆ?

ಬೀಚಿ: ಯಾರು ಹುಟ್ಟಿದ್ದರಿಂದ ದೇಶಕ್ಕೆ ಒಳ್ಳೆದಾಯಿತೋ, ಅವರ ಹುಟ್ಟಿದ ಹಬ್ಬವನ್ನು ಆಚರಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಆದರೆ ಯಾರು ಸತ್ತಿದ್ದರಿಂದ ದೇಶಕ್ಕೆ ಒಳ್ಳೆದಾಯಿತೋ, ಅವರ ಪುಣ್ಯ ತಿಥಿಗಳನ್ನು ಆಚರಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ.

ವೆಂಕಟ್ ಸೇನೆಯ ಧ್ವಜ ಅರ್ಧಕ್ಕೆ ಇಳಿಕೆ.

ಅಭಿಮಾನಿಗಳು ಅತಿರೇಕ ವರ್ತನೆ ಮಾಡದಂತೆ ಸಿಎಂ ಮನವಿ
ಟಿಪ್ಪು ವಿವಾದ ತಣ್ಣಗೆ ಮಾಡಲು ಸರ್ಕಾರ ಈ ರೀತಿ ಮಾಡಿದೆ ಅಂತಾ ವಿಪಕ್ಷಗಳ ಆರೋಪ

17/11/2015, 12:58 pm - Chatura: ಕಿಚ್ಚ ಸುದೀಪ್ ಉತ್ತರಿಸಲೇ ಬೇಕು

ಹುಚ್ಚ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ರವಿಯವರ ಮೇಲೆ ಹಲ್ಲೆ ಮಾಡಿದ್ದು ತಪ್ಪು ಅದನ್ನು ನಮ್ಮ ಸಮಾಜ ಒಪ್ಪುದಿಲ್ಲ
ದೇಹಕ್ಕೆ ಮಾಡುವ ಹಲ್ಲೆ ಎಷ್ಟು ಅಪರಾಧವೊ ಹಾಗೆಯೇ ಒಬ್ಬ ಮನುಷ್ಯನ ಮನಸ್ಸಿನ ಮೇಲೆ ಮಾಡುವ ಹಲ್ಲೆ ಅಷ್ಟೇ ದೊಡ್ಡ ಅಪರಾಧ.
ಸುದೀಪ್ ಅವರೆ ಹುಚ್ಚ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ರವಿಯವರ ಮೇಲೆ ದೈಹಿಕ ಹಲ್ಲೆ ಮಾಡಿದಾಗ ಅವರ ಬಾಯಿಯಿಂದ ಬಂದ ರಕ್ತಕ್ಕೆ ಇರುವ ಬೆಲೆ ರೆಹಮಾನ್. ಚಂದನ್. ರವಿ.ಈ ಮೂವರು ಸೇರಿ ಹುಚ್ಚ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ಅವರ ಮನಸ್ಸಿನ ಮೇಲೆ ಮಾಡಿದ ಹಲ್ಲೇಯ ಪರಿಣಾಮ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ಅವರ ಕಣ್ಣಿಂದ ಬಂದ ಕಣ್ಣೀರೀಗೆ ಬೆಲೆ ಇಲ್ಲವೇ.
ದೇಹಕ್ಕಾಗುವ ನೋವಿಗೆ ಔಷದಿ ಇದೆ ಸ್ವಾಮಿ ಆದರೆ ಮನಸ್ಸಿಗೆ ಆಗುವ ಔಷದಿ ಇದೆಯೇ ಹೇಳಿ.
ರೆಹಮಾನ್. ಚಂದನ್.ರವಿಯವರು ಕಳೆದ ವಾರದಿಂದ ಹುಚ್ಚ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ರವರಿಗೆ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಗತವಾಗಿ. ವೃತ್ತಿಗತವಾಗಿ .ಮಾನಸಿಕವಾಗಿ ನಿಂದಿಸಿದ್ದು ಅವಮಾನಿಸಿದ್ದು ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರು ನೋಡಿದ್ದಾರೇ ನೆನಪಿರಲಿ.
ಹುಚ್ಚ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ಅವರಿಗೆ ನೀವು ಹೇಳಿದ ಸಿನಿಮೀಯ ಡೈಲಾಗ್ ಅದ್ಬತವಾಗಿದ್ದವು.ಆದರೆ ನೀವು ಹೇಳಿದ ಡೈಲಾಗ್ ಗಳಿಗೆ ನೀವೆ ಉತ್ತರಿಸಿ
Bigger boss ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಸ್ಪರ್ಧಾಳುಗಳು ನನ್ನ ಮನೆಯವರಿದ್ದಂತೆ ಅವರ ಮೇಲೆ ತೊಂದರೆ ಆದರೆ ನನಗೆ ನಿನಗೆ ನೇರ ಯುದ್ಧ ಎಂದು ಸನ್ನೆ ಮಾಡಿದಿರಿ ಯಾಕೆ ಸುದೀಪ್ sir ಹುಚ್ಚ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ಸಹ bigg boss ಸ್ಪರ್ದಿ ಅಲ್ಲವೇ ಯಾಕೆ ಇಂತಹ ಬೇದ ಭಾವ.
ಹೆಣ್ಣು ಮಕ್ಕಳನ್ನ ಕಾಪಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳಲು ಅವರ ಮನೆಯವರು ಇದ್ದಾರೆ ಬೇರೆ ಮನೆಯ ಗಂಡಸು ಬೇಕಿಲ್ಲ ಎಂದು ಹೇಳಿದ್ದಿರಿ 
ಮುಂದೊಂದು ದಿನ ರಸ್ತೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಕಣ್ಣ ಮುಂದೆ ಒಂದು ಹೆಣ್ಣು ತೊಂದರೆಗೆ ಸಿಲುಕಿದರೆ ಕಾಪಾಡುವಿರೊ ಇಲ್ಲ ಅವರ ಮನೆಯವರು ಕಾಪಾಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳಲು ಎಂದು ಬಿಟ್ಟು ಹೋಗುತ್ತೀರೊ
ಸಮಾಜಕ್ಕೆ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಸಂದೇಶವೇನು ಸ್ವಾಮಿ
ನಿಜ ಸುದೀಪ್ ಈ ದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿ ಯಾರು ಹೆಣ್ಣಿನ ಬಟ್ಟೆಯ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ನಮ್ಮ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಯಾರು ಮಾತನಾಡುತ್ತಾರೊ ಅವರಿಗೆ ಹುಚ್ಚನ ಪಟ್ಟ ಕೊಮುವಾದಿಯ ಪಟ್ಟ ಕಟ್ಟುವುದು ಸಹಜ ಬಿಡಿ .
ನಂತರ ಹುಚ್ಚ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ಬಳಸುವ ಎಕ್ಕಡ ಅನ್ನುವ ಪದಕ್ಕೆ ನೀವು ಹೇಳಿದ ಮಾತು ಎಕ್ಕಡ ಕಾಲಲ್ಲಿ ಇರಬೇಕು ಅಂತ ಅಲ್ಲವೇ ಅದೇ ಕಾಲಲ್ಲಿ ಇರಬೇಕಾದ ಎಕ್ಕಡವನ್ನು ಇದೇ bigg boss ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ಅವರ ತಲೆ ಮೇಲೆ ಇಟ್ಟು ಕೊಳ್ಳುವ ಶಿಕ್ಷೆ ಕೊಟ್ಟಿದ್ದು ಸರಿಯೇ ಸುದೀಪ್.
ನನ್ನ ಎಕ್ಕಡ ಅಂತ ಹೇಳಿ ಹೇಳಿ ಅಭಿಮಾನಿಗಳನ್ನು ಪಡೆದ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ಅದೇ ಎಕ್ಕಡ ತಲೆ ಮೇಲೆ ಇಟ್ಟುಕೊಂಡು ಕನ್ನಡಿಗರ ಅಭಿಮಾನ ಅಷ್ಟೇ ಅಲ್ಲ ಅದೆಷ್ಟೋ ತಂದೆ ತಾಯಿಯರ ಆಶಿರ್ವಾದ ಗಳಿಸೊದ್ದಾರೆ ಹೇಗೆ ಗೊತ್ತ
 ಬೇರೆಯವರ ಕಾಳು ಹಿಡಿದರೆ ತನ್ನ ಸ್ವಾಭಿಮಾನಕ್ಕೆ ತೊಂದರೆ ಆಗುವುದು ಎಂದು ಹಠಕ್ಕೆ ಕುಳಿತ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ಅವರಿಗೆ ರೆಹಮಾನ್.ಚಂದನ್.ಅದೆಷ್ಟು ನಿಂದಿಸಿದರು ಅವಮಾನಿಸಿದರು ತಾಳ್ಮೆ ಕಳೆದು ಕೊಳ್ಳದ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ತನ್ನ ತಂದೆಯ ಚಪ್ಪಲಿಯನ್ನು ಪ್ರಸಾದದಂತೆ ತಲೆಯ ಮೇಲೆ ಇಟ್ಟುಕೊಂಡಾಗ
ಅದನ್ನು ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕುಳಿತು ನೋಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದ ಅದೆಷ್ಟೋ ತಂದೆ ತಾಯಿಯ ಕಣ್ಣಲ್ಲಿ ಕಂಬನಿ ಬಂದಿರುತ್ತದೆ ಯಾಕೆ ಗೊತ್ತ ವಯಸ್ಸಾದ ತಂದೆ ತಾಯಿಯನ್ನು ಕೀಳು ಮಟ್ಟದಲ್ಲಿ ನೋಡುವ ಮಕ್ಕಳು ವೃದ್ದಾಶ್ರಮಕ್ಕೆ ಸೇರಿಸು ಮಕ್ಕಳೇ ಇರುವಾಗ ತಂದೆಯ ಚಪ್ಪಲಿಗೆ ಇಷ್ಟು ಬೆಲೆ ಕೊಡುವ ಇಂತಹ ಒಬ್ಬ ಮಗ. ನಮಗು ಹುಟ್ಟಲಿ ಎಂದು ಪ್ರತಿ ತಂದೆ ತಾಯಿ ಬಯಸುತ್ತಾರೆ.
ತಂದೆ ಮಾಡಿಟ್ಟ ಹಣ ಜೇಬಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಇಟ್ಟುಕೊಳ್ಳುವವನು ಮಗನಲ್ಲ ತಂದೆಯ ಚಪ್ಪಲಿಯನ್ನು ಸಮಾಜ ಮುಂದೆ ತಲೆಯ ಮೇಲೆ ಇಟ್ಟುಕೊಳ್ಳುವವನು ನಿಜವಾದ ಮಗ.
ಸುದೀಪ್ sir bigg boss ನಿಯಮ ನಾವು ನೋಡಿದ್ದೇವೆ
ಕಳೆದ ವರ್ಷದ bigg boss ನಲ್ಲಿ ಅಕುಲ್ ಬಾಲಾಜಿ R J ರೋಹಿತ್ ಮೇಲೆ ಮತ್ತು ಆದಿ ಲೋಕೇಶ್ ಮೇಲೆ ಹಲ್ಲೆ ಮಾಡಿದಾಗ ನಿಮ್ಮ ನಿಯಮಗಳು ಮತ್ತು ನಿಮ್ಮ ರೋಷ ಎಲ್ಲಿ ಹೋಗಿತ್ತು ಅಂದು ಇಲ್ಲದ ನಿಯಮ ರೊಷ ಇಂದು ಯಾಕೆ ಹುಚ್ಚ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ಗೊಂದು ನ್ಯಾಯ ಅಕುಲ್ ಬಾಲಾಜಿಗೆ ಒಂದು ನ್ಯಾಯ ಯಾಕೆ 
ಇಷ್ಟಕ್ಕೆಲ್ಲಾ ನೇರ ಕಾರಣ ರೆಹಮಾನ್ .
ಒಬ್ಬ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ಪದೇ ಪದೇ ನಿಂದಿಸಿದರೆ ಎಂತಹ ಹರಡಿತು ಕೆರಳುತ್ತಾನೆ ಅಂತಹುದರಲ್ಲಿ ಕೊಪಿಷ್ಟ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ಮಾಡಿದ್ದು ತಪ್ಪಲ್ಲ
ಒಬ್ಬ ಪತ್ರಕರ್ತನಾಗಿರುವ ರೆಹಮಾನ್ bigg boss ನಲ್ಲಿ ಗೆಲ್ಲುವ ಕುದುರೆ ಯಾರೆಂದು ತಿಳಿದಿರುವುದರಿಂದ ತನ್ನ ಕುತಂತ್ರ ಬುದ್ಧಿಯಿಂದ ಹುಚ್ಚ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ಮತ್ತು ಸುನಾಮಿ ಕಿಟ್ಟಿಯನ್ನು target ಮಾಡುತ್ತಿರೊದು ಗೊತ್ತಿರುವ ವಿಷಯ 
ನಿಮ್ಮ ರಿಯಾಲಿಟಿ ಶೋ ಪಾರದರ್ಶಕವಾಗಿದ್ದರೆ ಕಳೆದ ವರ್ಷ ನಡೆದ bigg boss ನಲ್ಲಿ ಅಕುಲ್ ಬಾಲಾಜಿ ಸಹ ಸ್ಪರ್ಧಿಗಳ ಮೇಲೆ ಹಲ್ಲೆ ನಡೆಸಿದರು ಅಂದು ಅವರು ವಿನ್ನರ್ ಆದರೆ ಇಂದು ಹಲ್ಲೆ ನಡೆಸಿದ ಹುಚ್ಚ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ಯಾಕೆ ವಿಲನ್
ಉತ್ತರಿಸಿ ಸುದೀಪ್

ಈ ಸುದ್ದಿ ಎಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ತಿಳಿಸಿ ಸುದೀಪ್ ಗಮಾನಕ್ಕೆ ಬಂದು ಹುಚ್ಚ ವೆಂಕಟ್ ರನ್ನು ಪುನಃ ನುಗ್ಗಿ ಬಾಸ್ ಗೆ ಸೇರ್ಪಡೆ ಮಾಡಬೇಕು

20/11/2015, 12:13 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: The Most talked movie of the year finally arrived on Indian Cinema screens. The British Super Spy flick picks up from the second half and keeps all the bond fans hooked till the end.

Sadly, Craig looks old as he trying to take down the global criminal syndicate called ‘Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion’ a.k.a. #SPECTRE

This might be Craig’s last movie as the 007 ever since the reboot ‘#Casino_Royale’. 

#SanskariJamesBond The CBFC trimmed the movie by censoring 50% of the steamy parts.

27/11/2015, 11:12 pm - Abhilash: Reporter:- PM sir; which fruit do you like?
Modi:- Apple
Reporter:- Breaking news---
Modi does not like Mangoes; Banana; etc.
Let’s ask Congress their views on this.
Manish Tewari:- Modi like Apple means Red color.
This means he likes bloodshed
This means he does not want peace and harmony in
the country
Ahmed Patel:- This means Modi is only promoting
Hindutva.
He does not like green fruits means he is against
Muslims.
This clearly shows Modi has no feelings for Muslims.
Nitish Kumar:- This attitude of Modi is what made us
split from NDA.
Rahul Gandhi:- Modi never says which chocolate he
likes.
Arnab Goswami :
The nation wants to know why Modi likes apple more
than other fruits
The Nation has the right to know this.
Sonia Gandhi:- People of India please ask from where
Modi is going to get the money to buy such an
expensive fruit.
Geelani:- This is Modi’s tactic to usurp Kashmir.
We will not allow this to happen.
Yechuri:- Selecting an expensive fruit like Apple shows
Modi is pro- capitalist. It also means he is pro
corporate and wants to promote Apple products
indirectly. Why is he not saying about Samsung etc.
We want a CBI enquiry.
Kejriwal:- Traditionally Mango is considered the King of
Fruits.
Modi is anti tradition. This is against the interest of
the aam aadmi.
Foreign Media:- Modi’s communal policies are hurting
the secular fabric of India.
Common man - God save this country
😀 This is beautiful..,, Couldn't stop myself from
forwarding this Excellent message ...

Man then placed a piece of paper in her hand:" i have written some wisdom for you.read before u sleep" and went away..

Girl went back to hostel with tears and before sleep she opens the paper.

"Are you blind?my wife was standing behind me..anyways this is my number call me anytime..by the way.. i love u too!"

MEN ARE MEN..

06/12/2015, 9:14 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: Yeah, use PayTM for recharging purposes only, its very efficient.
Flipkart is the best
06/12/2015, 9:20 am - Nagendra: I really enjoy using Pockets by ICICI Bank. You can earn

06/12/2015, 9:31 am - Nagendra: M yet to hear that audio
06/12/2015, 9:32 am - Nagendra: I will listen n then tell
06/12/2015, 9:32 am - Nagendra: What u r saying is right
06/12/2015, 9:34 am - Nagendra: What theja telling is right but at this time. Other communities need his speech then Hindus .. No Hindu s going n forcing ppl to convert to Hindu .. No Hindu is marrying more to make Hinduism grow .. Hindus r chilling with their work.. Others only feeling insecure n feeling theirs s bigger than ours n they want us to convert to theirs
06/12/2015, 9:36 am - Abhilash: Exactly
06/12/2015, 9:39 am - Abhilash: Caliphate
06/12/2015, 9:47 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: Christening is more
06/12/2015, 9:47 am - Theja: Religion and all man made 
Y hate people
06/12/2015, 9:48 am - Nagendra: What theja tells is all r equal treat everyone equally.. What ab s telling is Hindus r not creating any intolerance n all m. Basically both r saying same point in different ways .. Ab telling allow Hindus to be their own n let others also live.  Live n let live policy .. Ab telling srk can't comment on Hindus because Hindus don't hate srk
06/12/2015, 9:49 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: 👍
06/12/2015, 9:49 am - Abhilash: Ya
06/12/2015, 9:50 am - Nagendra: Theja misunderstanding that ab hates Muslim
06/12/2015, 9:50 am - Nagendra: It's not like tat
06/12/2015, 9:50 am - Nagendra: It's simple v live way we want we won't trouble them .. Let them live way they want n don't trouble us
06/12/2015, 9:51 am - Theja: Ya even they sd not comment religious
06/12/2015, 9:51 am - Nagendra: Exactly
06/12/2015, 9:52 am - Abhilash: Ya
06/12/2015, 9:53 am - Abhilash: Being secular doesn't mean we shud support them
06/12/2015, 9:53 am - Abhilash: Wen thy are telling against us
06/12/2015, 9:53 am - Abhilash: Live n let live
06/12/2015, 9:55 am - Nagendra: They need this gyaan more actually at current situation .. That's what I feel
06/12/2015, 9:56 am - Abhilash: Ya but its hard, they think bjp is RSS, n against them, so these are all being created.
06/12/2015, 9:57 am - Nagendra: Preaching of Hinduism has drastically reduced .. In fact might be even 0%.. Preaching of other religions remain till today
06/12/2015, 9:58 am - Abhilash: Hmmm ya,
06/12/2015, 9:58 am - Nagendra: So theja pls do ur shit speech in front of them.. Ok oooooookkkk
06/12/2015, 9:59 am - Abhilash: My point being, wen a guy is made to transform from one religion to other, say Muslim, what guarantee that he might not change to some other again
06/12/2015, 9:59 am - Abhilash: So theja pls do ur shit speech in front of them.. Ok oooooookkkk
06/12/2015, 10:01 am - Nagendra: Religion n all man made .. Converting n all is meaningless.. Idealogy n principles of each religion differs .. Those idealogy were done 100s of years ago .. Which may not be completely applicable to current world..
06/12/2015, 10:03 am - Nagendra: It's like being born as guy n getting sex change operation to girl.. Why don't u be happy with what u r born..
06/12/2015, 10:03 am - Abhilash: Lol ya
06/12/2015, 10:04 am - Nagendra: Only theja n ab reading pings .. 😂

06/12/2015, 10:06 am - Abhilash: Oh k hmm
06/12/2015, 10:08 am - Nagendra: What I don't like about this srk amir comment n all is .. Common man only r silent .. These ppl with so much money n security n all they feel afraid it seems .. Sha alli
06/12/2015, 10:09 am - Nagendra: Say go n see in mandi mohalla all r happy only
06/12/2015, 10:10 am - Nagendra: Amir wife should be sent to Syria she will feel safe there
06/12/2015, 10:11 am - Abhilash: Ya ha ha
06/12/2015, 10:12 am - Abhilash: They r the ones creating intolerance by irresponsible comments
06/12/2015, 10:13 am - Nagendra: See their comment has created intolerance in anaga 😂
06/12/2015, 10:14 am - Abhilash: 😅😅
06/12/2015, 10:14 am - Theja: Consider current 
Christian's eat beef 
They also kill people 

But we are tolerant towards them we lick thier balls to get project 

We support Christmas go to church secret Santa 
Dress our kids like santa go to church 

But never support bakrid
Never go to masid

There is a clear discrimination 

There is a point they are trying to make
I agree with them
06/12/2015, 10:16 am - Nagendra: Muchappa .. Even during bakrid they arrange ifftar party something.. Some mutton biryani day n all ..
06/12/2015, 10:16 am - Nagendra: Who s stopping u from going masjid
06/12/2015, 10:17 am - Nagendra: Tomorrow morning go n pray in masjid .. Who gives a damm
06/12/2015, 10:18 am - Abhilash: Beef ban is for whole nation, not particularly Muslims,

We r participating in bakrid n all, but haven't seen a Muslim supporting Ganesh festival nor entering temples,

So we r tolerant to some other religion other than us, what r they upto?? Killing for converting
06/12/2015, 10:20 am - Abhilash: I have went to darga n ate the sakkar they gave, my Muslim fren here doesn't eat coconut from Temple nor tirupati laddoo, still we r tolerant
06/12/2015, 10:20 am - Nagendra: Haha
06/12/2015, 10:20 am - Nagendra: Theja s not knowing the entire picture
06/12/2015, 10:21 am - Abhilash: Ya like a kid
06/12/2015, 10:21 am - Nagendra: He s the one who has gone to church to see girls .. He didn't go masjid coz girls don't come 😂
06/12/2015, 10:22 am - Nagendra: Simply giving speech now as if v r going church daily 😅
06/12/2015, 10:22 am - Abhilash: 😂😂
06/12/2015, 10:24 am - Theja: You have gone once in life
06/12/2015, 10:25 am - Abhilash: Lo I don't even go to temple
06/12/2015, 10:26 am - Theja: Christmas is next month 
Do a case study 
How Hindus support 

But don't see entho during muslin fest 

It's mutual if you change they ll also come for Ganesha
06/12/2015, 10:26 am - Abhilash: It's not lik I hate them, they have beautiful chicks, how can I even hate😝
06/12/2015, 10:26 am - Nagendra: But theja going masjid is his wish .. He s not promoting ppl not to go masjid or go temple
06/12/2015, 10:27 am - Nagendra: No Hindu s beating muslim who goes masjid
06/12/2015, 10:27 am - Nagendra: How can u consider that as discrimination
06/12/2015, 10:28 am - Nagendra: I am vegetarian I eat veg.. How can u tell m discriminating non veg
06/12/2015, 10:28 am - Abhilash: Hmmm
06/12/2015, 10:28 am - Nagendra: When u eat non veg in same table if I slap u that's intolerance n discrimination
06/12/2015, 10:28 am - Abhilash: Ashte guru, point made
06/12/2015, 10:29 am - Abhilash: 😛
06/12/2015, 10:33 am - Theja: U may not hit physically but mentally 

There is a clear cut discrimination 
How you see a Muslim 
And how you see a Christian 

In society 
Media is not accecpting
06/12/2015, 10:36 am - Nagendra: Then nobody should hav seen srk movie since ppl hate him mentally
06/12/2015, 10:37 am - Nagendra: If media not accepting then y media even interview them
06/12/2015, 10:49 am - Vishak: Waa

10/12/2015, 7:55 pm - Abhilash: The day man dies, his money will still be in the bank or locker. 

When man is alive, he thinks he doesn’t have enough money to spend. 

When man passes away, there is still a lot of money in his bank account not spent.

A British tycoon passed away. He left for his widow 1 Billion Pounds in the bank. 

The widow remarried one of her husband’s young employees. 

The employee said, 
"All this while I thought I was working for my boss, I now realize that my boss was all the time working for me!”.

Moral of the Story:

It is more important to live longer than to have more wealth.

• Strive to have a strong and healthy body.

• In an expensive cell phone, 75% of the functions are useless.

• In an expensive car, 75% of the speed is not needed.

• In a big luxurious house, 75% of the space remains unoccupied or unutilized.

• In a whole wardrobe of clothes, 75% of them are rarely worn.

• Out of whole life’s earnings, 75% stays behind for other people to use.

• In every human being, 75% of the talent is not utilised.

So, how to make full use of our 25% ?

• Go for medical check-up even when you feel fit.

•  Drink more water even if you’re not thirsty.

• Let go your ego, whenever you can.

• Give in even if you are right.

• Be humble even if you are very powerful.

• Be contented even if you are not rich.

Have a Great Life 👍

Take care be blessed.🌟😇

11/12/2015, 7:57 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: A sexy Irish blonde at a Casino, seemed a little intoxicated 😎

She bet 20,000 Euro on a single Roll of dice.


She said - "I hope you don't mind, but I feel Luckier when I'm nude."

With that, she removed her clothes, rolled the dice and yelled-
"Come on baby, Mama needs new clothes!"

As the Dice came to a stop, she jumped and yelled - "Yes, Yes,
I Won.. I Won.."

She hugged each dealer and picked up her winnings and clothes and left.

The dealers gazed at each other, dumbfounded. Finally, one of them asked-
"What number rolled on the dice?"
The other - "I don't know, I thought you were watching."

Moral of the story:

1.Not All drunks are Drunk😉,
2.Not all Blondes are dumb😳, 
3.But all Men are Men!!!

19/12/2015, 3:17 pm - Bhavan Play: Father is flying a kite. His son is watching him carefully.
After some time son says "Dad. Because of the string the kite is not able to go any further higher."
Hearing this, the father smiles and breaks the string. The kite goes higher after breaking of the thread and then shortly after that it comes and falls on the ground. The child is very dejected and sad. The father sits next to him and calmly
explains:

"Son, in life we reach a certain level of
prosperity and then we feel that there are certain things in our life that are not letting us grow any further like Home, Family, Culture, Friendship etc. We feel we want to be free from those strings which we believe are stopping us from going higher."

"But, remember son. Going higher is
easier than staying at the higher level."

 "And friends, family and culture etc are the things that will help us stay stable at the high heights that we have achieved. If we try to break away from those strings our condition will be similar to the kite."

Moral
"Never go away from culture, family,
friends and relationships as they help
keep us stable while you are flying high."

Life is Beautiful.

23/12/2015, 8:01 pm - Anni jss: A woman and a man are involved in a car accident.

It's a bad collision , caused by the woman's reckless driving.

Both of their cars 
are demolished but amazingly neither of them a re hurt.

After they crawl out of their cars, the woman says;

"So, you're a handsome man. That's interesting. I'm a woman.

Wow, just look at our cars! There's nothing left, but fortunately we are unhurt.

This must be a sign from God that we should meet and be friends and live together in peace for the rest of our days."

The man replied," I agree with you completely. This must be a sign from God!

The woman continued, "And look at this, here's another miracle.

My car is completely damaged, but this bottle of wine didn't break.

Surely God wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune together." 
Then she hands the bottle to the man seductively.

The man nods his head in agreement, opens it, drinks half the bottle and then hands it back to the woman.

The woman takes the bottle, immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the man.

The man asks, "Aren't you having any?"

She replies, "Nah. I think I'll just wait for the police to come and collect their evidence."

ADAM  ATE  THE  APPLE AGAIN ! !

Men will NEVER learn ! 😂👌👍

25/12/2015, 8:47 am - Abhilash: A very poor woman with a small family called-in to a radio station asking for help from God.
A non-believer man who was also listening to this radio program decided to make fun of the woman.
He got her address, called his secretary and ordered her to buy a large amount of foodstuffs and take to the woman.
However, he sent it with the following instruction: "When the woman asks who sent the food, tell her that its from the devil.''
When the secretary arrived at the woman's house, the woman was so happy and grateful for the help that had been received. She started putting the food inside her small house.
The Secretary then asked her, ''Don't you want to know who sent the food?''
The woman replied, ''No, Say thanks to whomever sent ths! I don't care who the person is because when GOD orders, even the devil obeys!
WORRIES END

If BJP loses even one state - ‘Massive blow to Modi’. ‘Modi wave waning’.

If BJP wins, but with a slim margin - -‘Massive blow to Modi’. ‘Modi wave waning’. 

If BJP wins decisively - ‘EVMs rigged.’ ‘People voted on local issues’.

08/12/2018, 11:28 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: A mnc Employee Was Rewarded A Bicycle By His Organisation. It Was Very Beautiful But Didn't Have A Carrier At The Back, So He  Requested The Management To Get One Fixed.

When The Cycle Came Back, It Had The Carrier Fitted, But He Noticed That Now The Stand Was Removed. So He Asked About The Missing Stand.

Boss Said: There Is Only One Thing Possible In Pvt. Job - Either CAREER Or STAND.  If You Take A Stand, Your CAREER Will Be Finished, And If You Want To Make A CAREER, Never Take A STAND.

Dedicated To All mnc Employees...

ಆದರೂ ಅವಳ ಅಗಲ ಕಣ್ಣಿಗೆ ಬಿದ್ದಿದ್ದೆನಂತೆ,
ವಯಸ್ಸು ಎಂಟು, ತರಗತಿ ನಾಲ್ಕಂತೆ

ಕೆಂಪು ಬಣ್ಣಿಸಿದ್ಲು ತುಟಿಗೆ
ತಿಳಿಯುವ ಪ್ರಾಯವದು
ಮುತ್ತು ಕೊಡುವ ಹಂಬಲವಿತ್ತಂತೆ,
ವಯಸ್ಸು ಹದಿಮೂರು
ತರಗತಿ ಏಳಂತೆ

ಹಾಕಿದ್ಲು ಬಿಳಿ ಮಿಡಿ, ಕಾಣೋವರೆಗೂ ಮಂಡಿ
ತಿಳಿದಿದ್ದ ಪ್ರಾಯವದು
ಇನ್ನೂ ತಿಳಿಯುವ ಆಸೆಯಂತೆ,
ವಯಸ್ಸು ಹದಿನಾರು
ತರಗತಿ ಹತ್ತಂತೆ

ಉಟ್ಟಿದ್ಲು ನೀಲಿ ಸೀರೆ
ನೀಯತ್ತು ನಿಲ್ಲಲಿಲ್ಲ, ಅದು ಖರೆ
ಕಂಡಿತು ನಡು ಸಣ್ಣ, ಅಗಲ ನಾಭಿ
ತಿಳಿಸುವ ಪ್ರಾಯವದು
ವಯಸ್ಸು ಇಪ್ಪತ್ತು
ತರಗತಿ ಅದೂಗತಿ

( ಉದಾಹರಣೆಗೆ, ನೀವು ಬೆಳಿಗ್ಗೆ 9 ಗಂಟೆಗೆ ಒನ್ ವೇ ಟೋಲ್ ಟಿಕೇಟ್ ಪಡೆದು ಹೊರಟರೆ, ರಾತ್ರಿ 9 ಗಂಟೆಯ ಒಳಗೆ ಅದೇ ಟೋಲ್ ಗೇಟ್ ನಲ್ಲಿ ವಾಪಾಸು ಬಂದರೆ, ಟೋಲ್ ಪಾವತಿಸಬೇಕಿಲ್ಲ. 
  ಆದರೆ, ಸಾರ್ವಜನಿಕರಿಗೆ ಇದರ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಮಾಹಿತಿ ಇಲ್ಲದಿರುವುದರಿಂದ,  ಟೋಲ್ ಗುತ್ತಿಗೆದಾರರು ಇದನ್ನು ಮುಚ್ಚಿಟ್ಟು ಪ್ರತೀ ದಿನ ವಾಹನ ಸವಾರರಿಂದ ಲಕ್ಷಾಂತರ ರೂ. ಲೂಟಿ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಸಾರ್ವಜನಿಕರು ಇದನ್ನು ಅರಿತು, ಎಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ಜಾಗೃತಿ ಮೂಡಿಸಬೇಕು. ಟೋಲ್ ಹೆಸರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಸಾರ್ವಜನಿಕರ ಹಣ ಲೂಟಿಯಾಗುವುದನ್ನು ತಪ್ಪಿಸಬೇಕು.

ಬಂದಿತೇ ಹೊಸ ಸಂವತ್ಸರ
ಕೇಳದೆ ಯಾರ ಅನುಮತಿ
ಸಿಗದಿವರಿಗೆ ಸಿಗಲಿ ಒಬ್ಬಳು ಒಡತಿ
ಸಿಕ್ಕಿದವರಿಗೆ ಆಗಲಿ ಒಂದು ಪ್ರಾಪ್ತಿ

09/01/2019, 11:13 pm - Lola Infosys: Mostly fake again..
09/01/2019, 11:13 pm - Vishak: 8 lakhs less means almost all r economically backward

09/01/2019, 11:21 pm - Lola Infosys: True
09/01/2019, 11:22 pm - Lola Infosys: But, economically weak means, they don't have access to quality to make themselves good quality
09/01/2019, 11:23 pm - Vishak: Swalpa meter iddre they must reduce SC st reservations then they will loose votes but will be good for country but I doubt they will do

RaGa : This is not the answer of the important question i have raised

Modiji : Don't talk like a fool.

RaGa : My question is simple what did you have for lunch yesterday night.

Modiji : Listen dear Raga yesterday night i had khichdi with 3 chapatis and a little chaas with 1 apple and it was 11pm in the night and that is called dinner & not lunch.

RaGa : Don't give me such long reply to a simple question asked 
WHAT lunch DID YOU HAVE TONIGHT ?

Modiji: 🙄 ??

RaGa : Since you are not able to answer a simple question raised , its very clear that there is something fishy about the lunch you had yesterday night. I demand a independent committee to further investigate this very serious matter.

18/01/2019, 12:22 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: ವಿದ್ಯುತ್ತನ್ನು ಕಂಡುಹಿಡಿದಿದ್ದು ಬೆಂಜಮಿನ್ ಪ್ರ್ಯಾಂಕ್ಲಿನ್ ಅಲ್ಲಾ ಬದಲಿಗೆ ಅಗಸ್ತ್ಯ ಮುನಿ..! ಸಾಕ್ಷಿ ಇಲ್ಲಿದೇ ಓದಿ..!

ವಿದ್ಯುತ್ತನ್ನು ಕಂಡುಹಿಡಿದಿದ್ದು ಬೆಂಜಮಿನ್ ಪ್ರ್ಯಾಂಕ್ಲಿನ್ಎಂದು ಹೇಳುತ್ತೇವೆ….

ಇದೇ ಬೆಂಜಮಿನ್ ತಾವು ಬರೆದ ಒಂದು ಪುಸ್ತಕದಲ್ಲಿ  ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾರೆ.. 

“ಒಂದು ರಾತ್ರಿ ನಾನು ಭಾರತದ ಪ್ರಾಚೀನವಾದ ಒಂದು ಗ್ರಂಥವನ್ನು ಓದಿದೆ. ಅದರಲ್ಲಿನ ಒಂದು ವಾಕ್ಯ ರಾತ್ರಿಯಿಡೀ ನನ್ನನ್ನು ಕಾಡುತ್ತಿತ್ತು. ಯೋಚಿಸಿ ಯೋಚಿಸಿ ಆ ವಾಕ್ಯದ ಅರ್ಥವನ್ನು ಗ್ರಹಿಸಿದೆ. ಅದು ನನಗೆ ವಿದ್ಯುತ್ತನ್ನು ಕಂಡು ಹಿಡಿಯಲು ನೆರವಾಯಿತು“

ಹಾಗಾದರೆ ಆ ವಾಕ್ಯ ಯಾವುದು…?

ಅದು ಅಗಸ್ತ್ಯಮುನಿಗಳು ಬರೆದ “ಅಗಸ್ತ್ಯ ಸಂಹಿತೆ” ಯಲ್ಲಿನ ಒಂದು ವಾಕ್ಯವಾಗಿತ್ತು…!!!

ಮಹರ್ಷಿ ಅಗಸ್ತ್ಯರು, ಮಹಾರಾಜ ದಶರಥನ ರಾಜಗುರುವಾಗಿದ್ದರು. ಸಪ್ತರ್ಷಿಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಒಬ್ಬರಾಗಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಅವರು “ಅಗಸ್ತ್ಯ ಸಂಹಿತಾ” ಎಂಬ ಗ್ರಂಥವನ್ನು ಬರೆದಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಆಶ್ಚರ್ಯಕರ ಸಂಗತಿಯೇನೆಂದರೆ ಅಗಸ್ತ್ಯ ಸಂಹಿತೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ವಿದ್ಯುತ್ ಉತ್ಪಾದನೆಗೆ ಸಂಬಂಧಿಸಿದ ಅನೇಕ ವಿಷಯಗಳಿವೆ…!!

ಈ ಶ್ಲೋಕಗಳನ್ನು ನೋಡಿ…

ಸಂಸ್ಥಾಪ್ಯ ಮೃಣ್ಮಯೇ ಪಾತ್ರೇ
ತಾಮ್ರಪತ್ರಂ ಸುಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಮ್ ।
ಛಾದಯೇಚ್ಛಿಖಿಗ್ರೀವೇಣ
ಚಾರ್ದಾಭಿಃ ಕಾಷ್ಠಪಾಂಸುಭಿಃ ॥
ದಸ್ತಾಲೋಷ್ಟೋ ನಿಧಾತ್ವಯಃ ಪಾರದಾಛಾದಿತಸ್ತತಃ ।
ಸಂಯೋಗಾಜ್ಜಾಯತೇ ತೇಜೋ
ಮಿತ್ರಾವರುಣ ಸಂಜ್ಞಿತಮ್ ॥

ಈ ಶ್ಲೋಕದ ಕಂಗ್ಲೀಷಾಣುವಾದ ಹೀಗಿದೆ

ಒಂದು ಮಣ್ಣಿನ ಪಾತ್ರೆಯನ್ನು ತೆಗೆದುಕೊಳ್ಳಿ ; ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ತಾಮ್ರದ ಪಟ್ಟಿಯನ್ನು ಹಾಕಿ ; ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ Copper sulphate ಹಾಕಿ, ಅನಂತರ ಮಧ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ Wet saw dust ನ್ನು ಹಾಕಿ ; ಮೇಲಿನ ಭಾಗದಲ್ಲಿ Mercury ಹಾಗೂ Zink ನ್ನು ಉಪಯೋಗಿಸಿ. ಆಮೇಲೆ ತಂತಿಗಳನ್ನು ಸೇರಿಸಿ. ಆಗ ಮಿತ್ರಾವರುಣಶಕ್ತಿಯ (ವಿದ್ಯುತ್) ಉತ್ಪಾದನೆಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ..

ಬೆಂಜಮಿನ್ ವಿದ್ಯುತ್ ಕಂಡುಹಿಡಿಯಲು ಇಷ್ಟು Clue ಸಾಕಲ್ವಾ ಮಿತ್ರರೇ…?

ಇಷ್ಟೇ ಅಲ್ಲ. ಅಗಸ್ತ್ಯ ಸಂಹಿತೆಯಲ್ಲಿ Electroplatingನ ವಿವರಣೆ ಕೂಡ ಸಿಗುತ್ತದೆ…

22/01/2019, 9:38 pm - Lola Infosys: During tea break in office today, my Korean colleague asked me "Please tell me who is Shivakumara Swami, why are millions of people in such deep grief over his demise?"

I asked him "Do you know Mother Teresa?"

He replied "Of course, world renowned Nobel Prize winner popular for her humanitarian works. We even had a paragraph about her in our textbooks"

I said "Very good. Now think about Mother Teresa, her accomplishments & her ecosystem, subtract religious conversions from it, subtract media publicity from it, add 132 educational institutions producing 50,000 graduates annually to strengthen Indian economy, add Gurukuls educating 10,000 students annually to safeguard traditional academic learning, add free meals facility to all students, add agricultural initiatives supporting 5 lakh farmers annually, and that's how you finally get Shivakumara Swamiji"

He exclaimed "Wow!! This is seriously unbelievable. He seems to be a role model for humanitarian efforts for the whole world. In South Korea, we knew about Indians like Mother Teresa & Mahatma Gandhi, but I wonder why we were never aware of Shivakumara Swamiji"

I said "There's a simple reason for it. The global media never tried to highlight his efforts & achievements, because he always wore saffron".

01/02/2019, 2:40 pm - Anni jss: <Media omitted>
01/02/2019, 2:55 pm - Anni jss: But I think due to increase to 5lk taxable income for people above 5lk will reduce..
01/02/2019, 2:57 pm - Anni jss: Like, if some is getting 15lk per annum now, he will come into 20% tax bracket. Since they increased it to 5lk, his taxable income will become less or equal to 10lk. Which means that person now will come under 10% tax bracket. So the same guy now will pay half the tax he is currently paying
01/02/2019, 3:01 pm - Nagendra: U r right
01/02/2019, 3:01 pm - Anni jss: 😁👍🏼

01/02/2019, 10:09 pm - Lola Infosys: Let it be known to one and all, Government is giving 75000 crores to the farmers. 75,000 crores. 

Our farmers are getting
1. Seeds at subsidy
2. Urea with no scam
3. Cheap loans
4. Fasal bima
5. 1.5 times MSP
6. Interest Subvention
7. Capital subsidy
8. Power
And now an income assistance of 6000 per annum.

@INCIndia liars are ignoring 1 to 8 and saying 17 per day. 


On the contrary, MP CM and Rajasthan CM are giving ten rupees as Waivers. 🙏

Farmers in India are smart. They have seen Rahul Gandhy who wants to steal 6k from the families.

11/02/2019, 12:32 pm - Lola Infosys: The younger brother defaulted loan & sold company to elder brother to repay loan. 

The elder brother took loan from same bank to take over the younger brother's company. 

Now the bank got reduced NPA with stronger loan book. Nothing came or gone despite everything got good. 

Company Share prices got doubled in a week.
Mukesh allowed Anil to announce bad news and drop the share prices. The public sold off and Mukesh bought the shares (through loan) at dead cheap prices. Now prices are high. He pays off the loan to the bank by transferring it shares or with partners/partial sell in public. He has a company at zero cost.

*That's Ambani Brothers for you*

12/02/2019, 9:12 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: ನಿಮ್ಮಲ್ಲಿ ಎಷ್ಟು ಜನಕ್ಕೆ ಗೊತ್ತಿದೆಯೋ ಇಲ್ವೋ ಗೊತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ರಾಜಕಾರಣದ ಜೊತೆ ಒಂದು ರೋಚಕತೆ ವಿಚಿತ್ರ ವಿಶ್ಮಯ ಅಡಗಿದೆ ಅದೇನು ಅಂದ್ರೆ ..... 
ಎಲ್ಲಿಯವರೆಗೂ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ಸಿನ ಒಬ್ಬ  ಪ್ರಧಾನಮಂತ್ರಿ ಜೀವಂತವಿರುತ್ತಾನೋ ಅಲ್ಲಿಯವರೆಗೂ ಮತ್ತೊಬ್ಬ ಪ್ರಧಾನ ಮಂತ್ರಿ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ಸಿನಿಂದ ಆಯ್ಕೆಯಾಗಿ ಬರಲ್ಲ.

ಉದಾಹರಣೆ:-....
ನೆಹರು ತೀರಿಕೊಂಡ ನಂತರ ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿ ಪ್ರಧಾನಮಂತ್ರಿಯಾದರು, ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಜಿ ತೀರಿಕೊಂಡ ನಂತರ ಇಂದಿರಾ ಗಾಂಧಿ ಪ್ರಧಾನಮಂತ್ರಿ ಆದ್ರು, 
ಇಂದಿರಾ ಗಾಂಧಿ ತೀರಿಕೊಂಡ ನಂತರನೆ ರಾಜೀವ ಗಾಂಧಿ ಆದ್ರು, ರಾಜೀವ್ ಗಾಂಧಿ ಸತ್ತ ನಂತರ  ಪಿ ವಿ ನರಸಿಂಹರಾವ್ ಪ್ರಧಾನ ಮಂತ್ರಿ ಆದ್ರು,  
ಆಮೇಲೆ ಎಲ್ಲಿಯವರೆಗೂ ಪಿ ವಿ ನರಸಿಂಹ ರಾವ್ ಸಾಯಲಿಲ್ಲವೋ ಅಲ್ಲಿಗಂಟ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಅಧಿಕಾರದಿಂದ ಹೊರಗಿತ್ತು ಮತ್ತು ಯಾವೊಬ್ಬ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ಸಿಗನೂ ಪ್ರಧಾನಿ ಆಗಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಯಾವಾಗ 2004ರಲ್ಲಿ ಪಿ ವಿ ನರಸಿಂಹ ರಾವ್ ನಿಧಾನರಾದರೊ ಆ ವರ್ಷವೇ ಮನಮೋಹನ್ ಸಿಂಗ್ ಪ್ರಧಾನಿಯಾದ್ರು🙄.

ಮ್ಯಾಟರ್ ಇಷ್ಟೇ ...ಎಲ್ಲಿಗಂಟ ಮನಮೋಹನ್ ಸಿಂಗ್ ಜೀವಂತವಾಗಿ ಇರ್ತಾರೋ ಅಲ್ಲಿಗಂಟ ಪಪ್ಪು ಅಷ್ಟೇ ಅಲ್ಲ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ಸಿನ ಯಾರೊಬ್ಬರೂ ಸಹ ಪ್ರಧಾನಮಂತ್ರಿ ಆಗಲ್ಲ.

ಆ ದೇವರು ಮನಮೋಹನ್ ಸಿಂಗ್ ಅವರಿಗೆ ಆಯುರಾರೋಗ್ಯ ಕೊಟ್ಟು ನೂರು ಕಾಲ ಸುಖವಾಗಿರಲಿ ಎಂದು ಬೇಡಿಕೊಳ್ತಿನಿ🙏😜

13/02/2019, 3:34 pm - Anni jss: Tweets on Twitter by Dr. Gaurav Pradhan, a genius in politics:  Worth sharing, with every Indian.

1 Many of you react and ask why @narendramodi not sending 10 JANPATH gang to Jail. Let me give you a small example if u have listening ears and strategically thinking mind.

2 Why did Indra Gandhi make a comeback? Charan Singh arrested her and she made an event out of it by sitting on Road. That Picture was on every front page and Indian Women cried for a Widow Indira Gandhi and the whole Game was changed.

3. You must have witnessed Sonia and Rahul going to Patiala house court for bail on National Herald case. Do you know on that day entire central Delhi was choked by congress ppl? Even it spilled over to Noida, Faridabad, Gurugram? Imagine if she is jailed? Congress Crooks will burn India.

4. Congress came back in power bcoz Indians are a bunch of emotional people. Modi doesn't want to repeat Charan Singh mistake bcoz he is here for a long game. He will finish his opposition without a bullet fired and he is master in it. He finished Congress in Gujarat.

5 What does he need from us? SUPPORT and Patience. Question is, Will u give him support so that he can take a bold step or u prefer drinking cheap petrol?

6. So when Subramanian Swamy Sir shouts about sending 10 JANPATH gang to jail, I get confused. Either he doesn't understand history or he is helping 10JP gang to revive.

7 . Just think what a THIEF does? Think from his mind. First he plans to rob. Then he carefully plans his escape route. Then he tests this route few times. Finally he robs the place. In 10 Years, the first 5 years Italian gang planned a robbery by creating a massive global network.

8 . This global network includes Indian and international journalists & media houses, Cartels like russian, American, Arabs. They made deals with arms brokers and all other powerful people.
Including Judiciary and Babus. Now if u touch them even remotely, The whole network gets activated and this network will ensure INDIA is derailed and burnt . Narendramodi is a good student. He learned these tricks while he was Gujarat CM for 14 years.

10. So now Modi is very careful. He ensured that when he walked, he didn't step on any landmine laid by Italian Gang. So he focused on people's development. One step at a time. He doesn't work against the law or tradition. He built global reputation to discredit overseas cartel.

11 On media, he didn't touch even a single Journo but using SM and directly communicating with people, he demolished the Kingdom set up by Intellectuals and Journos. Slowly he destroyed Media credibility

12 . He finished Arms broker cartel by govt to govt deals. This helped 100% transparency and clean deals. While Italian used international Cartel network, Modi used people's trust to demolish Italian Cartel.

13. By building International trust with NRIs and other govts, he sends a message that we are here for mutual growth. This way he turned around many govts who were against him. Example is UAE, Saudi, US, Australia, Russia etc

14. Last but not the least, He put Italian Mafia on deathbed where they are neither alive nor dead. Entire Italian network is now on slow death and LS2019 will finish them.

15. Hope you remember my big tree analogy "When the tree is too big, poison the roots and kill it bcoz if u cut the tree, the branches and trunk will fall on small plants (people of India) and will crush a large eco system".

16 This is why my trust on narendra modiji is not shakeable, no matter what the situation is bcoz one thing I know loud and clear. He is here for INDIA and not for personal wealth. The reason for me to vote him as long as he runs for PMship

17 Chamchagiri is not in my blood. My father taught me this trick. hence my only suggestion to you is, have faith in Narendra modiji and don't let negativity seep into you. Even for a moment If u are upset, take a break for few days.

14/02/2019, 3:38 pm - Lola Infosys: ವ್ಯಾಲೆಂಟೇನ್ ಡೆ'ಗೆ ಇನ್ನೂ ಏಳು ದಿನ ಬಾಕಿ ಇತ್ತು.
ವಕೀಲ ಸಾಹೇಬರು ಒಂದು ಗಿಪ್ಟ್ ಸೆಂಟರ್ ಒಳಗೆ ಹೊಕ್ಕರು.
ಅಲ್ಲಿ ಸುಂದರವಾದ 40 ಕಾರ್ಡಗಳನ್ನು ಖರೀದಿಸಿದ ಅವರು ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ಕಳುಹಿಸ ಬೇಕಾದ ಜಾಗದ ವಿಳಾಸವನ್ನು ಬರೆದರು -

"ಹಲೋ ಡಾರ್ಲಿಂಗ್ !! ಪರಿಚಯ ಆಯಿತು ತಾನೆ ?? ಇವತ್ತು ಸಂಜೆ ಬೇಟಿಯಾಗೋಣ, "ಐ ಲವ್ ಯೂ "!

ಅಂಗಡಿಯವ ಕೇಳಿದ :- ಇದು ವಿಷಯ ಎಂತ ??

ವಕೀಲರು ಹೇಳಿದರು :- ಹೋದ ವರ್ಷ ವ್ಯಾಲೆಂಟೇನ್ ಡೆ' ಯಲ್ಲಿ  ಆಸು ಪಾಸಿನ ಕಾಲೋನಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹೀಗೆ 20 ಕಾರ್ಡ್ ಕಳುಹಿಸಿದ್ದೆ.!  ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ದಿನದಲ್ಲೇ ನಾಲ್ಕು ಡೈವೋರ್ಸ ಕೇಸ್ ಸಿಕ್ಕೀತು !

ಈ ವರ್ಷ 40 ಕಾರ್ಡ್ ಕಳುಹಿಸುತಿದ್ದೇನೆ.!

ಬಿಜೆನೇಸ್'ಲ್ಲಿ ಎಲ್ಲವೂ ನಡೆಯುತ್ತದೆ.
ನನ್ನ ಅಮ್ಮ ಒಂದು ಮಾತು ಹೇಳುತಿದ್ದರು...
"ಯಾವ ವ್ಯಾಪರವು ಸಣ್ಣದಲ್ಲ ಮತ್ತು ವ್ಯಾಪರಕ್ಕಿಂತ ದೊಡ್ಡ ಧರ್ಮ ಯಾವುದೂ ಇಲ್ಲ"

ಅಂಗಡಿಯವ ಈಗ ಕೋಮದಲ್ಲಿದ್ದಾನೆ

How many fucking liberals will show you pics of died jawans?

15/02/2019, 11:42 am - Anni jss: ಈ ದಿನದ ಹತ್ಯಾಕಾಂಡದ ನಂತರ,
------------------------
ಇಷ್ಟು ದಿನ ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನು ನಖಶಿಖಾಂತ ದ್ವೇಷಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದ ಎಲ್ಲ ದೇಶದ್ರೋಹಿ ಹಡಬೆಗಳೂ ಒಂದಾಗಿ ಒಂದೇ ಸ್ವರದಲ್ಲಿ "ಈ ಕೃತ್ಯ ಮೋದಿಯ ವೈಫಲ್ಯ" ಎಂದು ಬೊಬ್ಬಿಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದರೆ, ಈ ಕೃತ್ಯದ ಹಿಂದಿನ "ಕೈ" ಯಾವುದು ಎಂಬುದು ಸ್ಪಷ್ಟ.

ಭ್ರಷ್ಟಾಚಾರ ಇಲ್ಲ. ವಿವಿಧ ಇಲಾಖೆಗಳ ವೈಫಲ್ಯದ ಉದಾಹರಣೆಗಳು ಸಿಕ್ಕಿಲ್ಲ. ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನು ದೂರಲು ಇದ್ದ ಒಂದೇ ಒಂದು ಸಂಗತಿ 'ರಾಫೇಲ್' ಕೂಡ ಮೊನ್ನೆಯಷ್ಟೇ ಸಿಎಜಿ ವರದಿಯಿಂದ ಹೊಗೆ ಹಾಕಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಿದೆ. ಸದ್ಯಕ್ಕೆ ಇಟಾಲಿಯನ್ ಯುವರಾಜನ ಬೆಟಾಲಿಯನ್ ನಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಎಲ್ಲ ಕ್ಷಿಪಣಿಗಳೂ ಠುಸ್ ಠುಸ್ ಎಂದು ನೆಲಕ್ಕೆ ಬೀಳುತ್ತಿವೆ. ಆತನ ಬತ್ತಳಿಕೆ ಖಾಲಿ ಖಾಲಿ. ಕೊಟ್ಟಕೊನೆಗೆ ಪಾಪಿಸ್ಥಾನಕ್ಕೆ ಕುಮ್ಮಕ್ಕು ಕೊಟ್ಟು ಯೋಧರ ಮೇಲೆ ದಾಳಿಯನ್ನಾದರೂ ಮಾಡಿಸಿ ಆ ಮೂಲಕ ಮೋದಿ ವಿಫಲ ಎಂದು ಕೂಗಿ ಹೇಳಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಆ ಮೂಲಕ ಮೋದಿಯ ಮೇಲೆ ಜನರ ಆಕ್ರೋಶ ಮುಗಿಲು ಮುಟ್ಟುವಂತೆ ನೋಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಮುಂದಿನ ಎರಡು ತಿಂಗಳು ಆ ಹವಾ ಕಾಯ್ದುಕೊಂಡರೂ ಸಾಕು, ಮೋದಿಗೆ ಬೀಳುವ ಓಟಿನ ಪ್ರಮಾಣವನ್ನು ಅಷ್ಟರಮಟ್ಟಿಗೆ ತಗ್ಗಿಸಬಹುದು. ಅಷ್ಟರಮಟ್ಟಿಗೆ ತನ್ನ ಸೀಟು ಗಳಿಕೆಯನ್ನು ಹೆಚ್ಚಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳಬಹುದು. 30-40 ಪಕ್ಷಗಳ ಜೊತೆ ಸೇರಿ, ಅವರ ಒಂದು ಎರಡು ಮೂರು ಸೀಟುಗಳನ್ನೆಲ್ಲ ಗುಡಿಸಿ ಒಟ್ಟು ಹಾಕಿ ಹೇಗೋ ಬಹುಮತ ಸಂಪಾದಿಸಿ ಅಧಿಕಾರ ಹಿಡಿಯಬಹುದು. ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನು ಅಧಿಕಾರದಿಂದ ದೂರ ಇಡುವುದೇ ಏಕೈಕ ಉದ್ದೇಶವಾಗಿರುವ ಎಲ್ಲ ಕಳ್ಳ-ಖೂಳರೂ ಈ ಘನಂದಾರೀ ಕೆಲಸದಲ್ಲಿ ತನ್ನ ಕೈ ಹಿಡಿದೇ ಹಿಡಿಯುತ್ತಾರೆ ಎಂಬುದೇ ಯುವರಾಜನಿಗಿರುವ ಅಚಲ ನಂಬಿಕೆ.

ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ಸೂಕ್ಷ್ಮವಿದೆ. ಯಾಕೆ ಈಗಲೇ, ಚುನಾವಣೆಗೆ ಎರಡು ತಿಂಗಳಿರುವಾಗಲೇ ಈ ದೊಡ್ಡ ಪ್ರಮಾಣದ ಹತ್ಯಾಕಾಂಡ ನಡೆದಿದೆ? ಕಾರಣಗಳನ್ನು ಹೀಗೆ ಪಟ್ಟಿ ಮಾಡಬಹುದು..

(1) ಈ ಮೂಲಕ ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನು ಅಧೀರಗೊಳಿಸುವುದು. ಚುನಾವಣಾ ಪ್ರಚಾರದ ಮೇಲೆ ಕರಿಛಾಯೆ ಮುಸುಕುವಂತೆ ಮಾಡುವುದು. ಚುನಾವಣೆಯತ್ತ ಮೋದಿ ಕೊಡಬೇಕಿದ್ದ ಗಮನವನ್ನು ರಕ್ಷಣಾ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆಯ ಕಡೆ ಕೊಡುವಂತೆ ಮಾಡಿ ಅಷ್ಟರಮಟ್ಟಿಗೆ ಮೋದಿ ಎಂಗೇಜ್ಡ್ ಆಗಿರುವಂತೆ ನೋಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದು.

(2) ಮೋದಿ, ಮತ್ತೆ ಸರ್ಜಿಕಲ್ ಸ್ಟ್ರೈಕ್ ಮಾಡಲು ಅಥವಾ ಯುದ್ಧ ಘೋಷಿಸಲು ತಡ ಮಾಡಿದರೆ 'ಏನ್ರೀ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಚೌಕಿದಾರ ಏನ್ ಮಾಡ್ತಿದಾನೆ? 56 ಇಂಚಿನ ಎದೆ ಎಲ್ಲಿ ಹೋಯ್ತು?' ಎಂದೆಲ್ಲ ಕಿಚಾಯಿಸುವುದು. ಆ ಮೂಲಕ, ಮೋದಿ ಓರ್ವ ಅಸಮರ್ಥ ನಾಯಕ ಎಂದು ಜನಸಾಮಾನ್ಯರಲ್ಲಿ ಬಿಂಬಿಸಲು ಯತ್ನಿಸುವುದು.

(3) ಮೋದಿ ಒಂದು ವೇಳೆ ಮತ್ತೆ ಸರ್ಜಿಕಲ್ ಸ್ಟ್ರೈಕ್ ಮಾಡಲು ಹೋದರೆ ಅಂತಾರಾಷ್ಟ್ರೀಯ ಮಟ್ಟದಲ್ಲಿ ಮೋದಿಯವರ ಮೇಲೆ ಒತ್ತಡ ತರುವುದು. ಮೋದಿ ಓರ್ವ blood thirsty ನಾಯಕ ಎಂದು ಬಿಂಬಿಸುವುದು. ಭಯೋತ್ಪಾದನೆಯನ್ನು ತಡೆಯಲು ಅಸಮರ್ಥ ನಾಯಕ ಎಂದು ಜಗತ್ತಿಗೆ ಕೂಗಿ ಹೇಳುವುದು. ಮೋದಿಯ ಪ್ರಭಾವ ತಗ್ಗಿಸಲು ಪ್ರಯತ್ನಿಸುವುದು.

(4) ಮೋದಿಯೇನಾದರೂ ದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿ ತುರ್ತು ಪರಿಸ್ಥಿತಿ ಘೋಷಿಸಿ ಯುದ್ಧಕ್ಕೆ ಸನ್ನದ್ಧರಾದರೆ ಆಕಾಶವೇ ಕಳಚಿ ಬಿತ್ತು ಎಂದು ಹಾರಾಡುವುದು. ದೇಶವನ್ನು ಯುದ್ಧದ ಅಂಚಿಗೆ ತಂದು ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸಿದ ನಾಯಕ ಎಂದು ದೇಶಾದ್ಯಂತ ಭಯದ ವಾತಾವರಣ ನಿರ್ಮಿಸುವುದು. ಚೀನಾ ಮೂಲಕ ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನು ಕಟ್ಟಿಹಾಕುವ ಕೆಲಸ ಮಾಡುವುದು. 

ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ಗಮನಿಸಿ. ಯೋಧರ ಹತ್ಯೆಯಾಗಿ ಕೇವಲ ಮೂರ್ನಾಲ್ಕು ತಾಸುಗಳೂ ಆಗಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಅಷ್ಟರಲ್ಲೇ ದೇಶದ ಬುದ್ಧಿಜೀವಿಗಳೆಲ್ಲ ಒಂದೇ ಸಲಕ್ಕೆ ಅಖಾಡಾಕ್ಕೆ ಧುಮುಕಿ ಮೋದಿಗೆ ಬುದ್ಧಿವಾದ ಹೇಳಲು ನಿಂತುಬಿಟ್ಟಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಯೋಧರ ಸಾವಿಗೆ ಮರುಗುವ ನಾಟಕವಾಡುತ್ತ, ಸಿಕ್ಕಿದ್ದೇ ಚಾನ್ಸ್ ಎಂದು ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನು ಹಳಿಯಲು ಈ ಸಂದರ್ಭ ಬಳಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. 'ಭಯೋತ್ಪಾದಕರ ಜೊತೆ ಮಾತುಕತೆ, ಚರ್ಚೆ ಮೂಲಕ ಶಾಂತಿ ಸಂಧಾನ ನಡೆಸಬೇಕು' ಎಂದು ಸಾಕ್ಷಿಪ್ರಜ್ಞೆಗಳು ಟ್ವಿಟ್ಟರ್ ನಲ್ಲಿ ಕುಟ್ಟುತ್ತಿವೆ. ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್ ಈಗಾಗಲೇ ತನ್ನ ಅಫಿಷಿಯಲ್ ಹೇಳಿಕೆಯನ್ನು ಬಿಡುಗಡೆಗೊಳಿಸಿದೆ. 'ಎಲ್ಲಿದೆ 56 ಇಂಚಿನ ಎದೆ? ಇದೇ ಏನು ನೀವು ದೇಶಕ್ಕೆ ಕೊಡುವ ಭದ್ರತೆ?' ಎಂದೆಲ್ಲ ಕಿಚಾಯಿಸಲು ನಿಂತಿದೆ ಈ 150 ವರ್ಷಗಳ ಇತಿಹಾಸವಿರುವ ಪಕ್ಷ. ಮೋದಿಯ ವಿರುದ್ಧ ನಿಂತಿರುವ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಸಣ್ಣ-ದೊಡ್ಡ ರಾಜಕೀಯ ಪಕ್ಷಗಳೂ ಈ ಹತ್ಯಾಕಾಂಡವನ್ನು ತಮ್ಮ ರಾಜಕೀಯ ಲಾಭಕ್ಕೆ ಬಳಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವುದು ಹೇಗೆ ಎಂದು ಲೆಕ್ಕ ಹಾಕುತ್ತಿವೆ. ಮೋದಿ ಅಸಮರ್ಥ, ನಮ್ಮ ರಕ್ಷಣಾ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆ ಸರಿಯಾಗಿಲ್ಲ, ಸರಿಯಾದ ಭದ್ರತಾ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆ ಇಲ್ಲ, ಇದು ಭದ್ರತಾ ವೈಫಲ್ಯ, ಕೇಂದ್ರ ಸರಕಾರದ ವೈಫಲ್ಯ, ಇಂಟೆಲಿಜೆನ್ಸ್ ಫೈಲ್ಯೂರ್ ಎಂದೆಲ್ಲ ತಮ್ಮ ಮೂಗಿನ ನೇರಕ್ಕೆ ವ್ಯಾಖ್ಯಾನ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಿವೆ. ಇನ್ನು ಮುಂದಿನ ನಾಲ್ಕೈದು ದಿನಗಳಲ್ಲಂತೂ ಇದು ತಾರಕಕ್ಕೆ ಮುಟ್ಟಲಿದೆ. ಇಷ್ಟು ದಿನ ಮೋದಿಯನ್ನು ಬೆಂಬಲಿಸುತ್ತ ಬಂದಿರುವ ಶ್ರೀ ಸಾಮಾನ್ಯನ ಮನಸಲ್ಲೂ ಮೋದಿಯ ಕುರಿತು ಒಂದು ಸಣ್ಣ ಅಸಮಾಧಾನ, ಸಂಶಯ ಹುಟ್ಟುವಂತೆ ಮಾಡಿದ್ದೇ ಆದರೆ ಅದೇ ಈ ಪಕ್ಷಗಳ ಸಾಧನೆ!

ಹಾಗಾದರೆ, ಈ ಹತ್ಯಾಕಾಂಡದ ಹಿಂದೆ ಇರುವವರು ಯಾರು? ಯೋಚಿಸಿ! ಈ ಹತ್ಯಾಕಾಂಡದ ಲಾಭ ಪಡೆಯಲು ಯಾವೆಲ್ಲ ರಣಹದ್ದುಗಳು ಕಾತರಿಸುತ್ತಿವೆ? ಯೋಚಿಸಿ! ಈ ಹತ್ಯಾಕಾಂಡವನ್ನು ನೆಪ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡು ಯಾರೆಲ್ಲ ಮೋದಿಯ ವಿರುದ್ಧ ಹರಿಹಾಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ? ಯೋಚಿಸಿ! ಈ ಹತ್ಯಾಕಾಂಡವನ್ನು ಯಾರೆಲ್ಲ ಗುಟ್ಟಾಗಿ ಸಂಭ್ರಮಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ? ಯೋಚಿಸಿ! ಈ ದೇಶವನ್ನು ಹರಿದು ಹಂಚಿ ತಿನ್ನಲು ಯಾವೆಲ್ಲ ನರಿ ನಾಯಿ ಹದ್ದು ಹಂದಿಗಳು ಬಾಯಿ ಬಾಯಿ ಬಿಟ್ಟು ಕಾಯುತ್ತಿವೆ? ಯೋಚಿಸಿ!

ಮೋದಿಯವರ ಪರಿಸ್ಥಿತಿ ನಮ್ಮನಿಮ್ಮಂತೆ ಸರಳವಾದುದಲ್ಲ. ಏಕಕಾಲಕ್ಕೆ ಅವರು ಪಾಪಿಸ್ಥಾನದ ಜೊತೆ, ಅತ್ತ ಚೀನಾದ ಜೊತೆ, ಮತ್ತೆ ರಷ್ಯದ ಜೊತೆ, ಅದರಾಚೆ ಅಮೆರಿಕವೆಂಬ ತಲೆಕೆಟ್ಟ ದೇಶದ ಜೊತೆ ಏಗಬೇಕಿದೆ. ಮಾತ್ರವಲ್ಲ, ದೇಶದೊಳಗೇ ಇದ್ದು ದೇಶದ ಬೊಡ್ಡೆಯನ್ನು ತೂತುಕೊರೆದು ಬೀಳಿಸುವ ಎಲ್ಲ ಒರಲೆಗಳೊಂದಿಗೂ ಹೆಣಗಬೇಕಿದೆ. ಕೇವಲ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೆಸ್, ಕಮ್ಯುನಿಸ್ಟ್ ಪಕ್ಷಗಳು ಮಾತ್ರವಲ್ಲ... ದೇಶದ ಛಪ್ಪನ್ನಾರು ಸಣ್ಣ ದೊಡ್ಡ ಪಕ್ಷಗಳೆಲ್ಲವೂ ಮೋದಿಯ ಅವಸಾನವನ್ನು ಚಾತಕಪಕ್ಷಿಗಳಂತೆ ಎದುರು ನೋಡುತ್ತಿವೆ ಎಂಬುದನ್ನು ಮರೆಯುವಂತಿಲ್ಲ. ಜೊತೆಗೆ, ದೇಶದ ಮಾನ-ಸಮ್ಮಾನಗಳನ್ನು ಹರಾಜು ಹಾಕಲೆಂದೇ ಬುದ್ಧಿಜೀವಿ ಚಿಂತಕರ ಪಡೆ ಸದಾ ಸನ್ನದ್ಧ. ಇವೆಲ್ಲ ದುಷ್ಮನ್ನರ ಜೊತೆ ಏಕಕಾಲಕ್ಕೆ ಅಭಿಮನ್ಯುವಾಗಿ ಸೆಣಸಬೇಕಾದ ಅನಿವಾರ್ಯತೆ ಸದ್ಯದ ಪ್ರಧಾನಿಗಳದ್ದು.

ಈ ವಿಪತ್ಕಾಲದಲ್ಲಿ ನೀವು ನಿಲ್ಲಬೇಕಾದ್ದು ಮೋದಿಯ ಜೊತೆಗಾ, ಅವರ ವಿರೋಧಿಗಳ ಜೊತೆಗಾ, ಯೋಚಿಸಿ!

15/02/2019, 8:51 pm - Vishak: I am not one to rush into political shaming on Social media . It only divides opinions and never give conclusions. 

But then what happened is #phulwama opened the same set of questions we always ask and then keep them back in the locker until next time.

1. There were 2547( as reported) Jawans and soldiers that were transported in two convoys in 78 Buses. Now when we all know the sensitivity and how the scenarios are in the valley. Cant we airlift our soldiers and make them reach safely. I mean not too big too ask. For a moment just think of what could have been . that is too many lives to gamble on. 

But why the question of Airlifting- Coz each Minister, MOS, Administrator, Left wing, right wing, media intellectual who would visit the valley, condemn the attack , chest and fist pump would be airlifted to the place.  Now who deserves it more is the question.

2. The media like Dogs and vultures would report every single thing for the next 10-15 days . The moment in valley, the meetings of officials, the army camps. Even their family members info would be revealed on television.

What For - To make a ready made intelligence report and submit for further events like #phulwama to the enemy. I am sure we can have sensibilities to differentiate between National security and the need to fill up your corporate Lockers.

3. A soldier's duty is to stand for the security of his mother land first, His fellow countrymen next and then the political brass who jumps to take the credit away.

But were-The soldier were never  meant to be martyred for our intelligence failings, own diplomatic priorities or to settle agendas.  

4. Masood Azhar should have been taken to the UN Council and should have been banned and necessary bans should have been put.

But what's the point- This wasn't done because CHINA didn't wanted it to be done. And we played soft belly to keep our diplomatic scores settled .  

The point is do we need the loss of 44 men to let us know the harsh truth of how we fail them each single time and put a condolence message.  

Until them #RIP . We failed you yet again. You deserved better.

18/02/2019, 8:52 am - Arun Bhadardwaj: FACTS ABOUT KASHMIR TERRORISM.

👁 👁    EYE  OPENER   👁 👁

State of J&K Under India ( Area wise 101380 sq Km) Excluding POK.

Kashmir  :  15%
Jammu   :  26%
Ladakh    :  59%

85,000 sq Km comprising 85% area are not Muslim Majority.

Population  - 1.25 Crores

Kashmir :  69 Lakhs. (Only 55 Lakhs speak Kashmiri. Rest 13 lakhs speak Non kashmiri languages.)

Jammu : 53 Lakhs.
(Dogri, Punjabi, Hindi)
 
Ladakh :  03 Lakhs. (Ladakhi language)

This does not include 7.5 lakh people settled who do not have citizenship.

There are 22 districts in J&K. Out of which only 5 Districts where separatists have the say ; 
Srinagar, Anantnag, Baramullah, Kulgam and Pulwama.  

Other 17 districts are Pro India.  
So separatist's writ runs in just 15% of the population which are Sunni Muslim dominated. 

Interestingly these 5 districts are far away from Pakistan Border/LOC.

There are more than fourteen major Religious/ ethinic groups comprising 85% of the population of J&K who are Pro India.

These include:

Shias ; 

Dogras: (Rajputs, Brahmins & Mahajans);

Kashmiri Pandits;

Sikhs; 

Buddhists ( Ladakhis ); 

Gujjars;

Bakarwals; 

Paharis; 

Baltis;

Christians & many more.

Majority of the people in J&K do not speak Kashmiri as their mother tongue. It's Dogri, Gujjari, Punjabi, Ladhaki , Pahari etc.

Only 33 % people in Kashmir speak Kashmiri & this group controls narrative from Hurriyat to militants and from NC and PDP.

This 33% controls business, bureaucracy & agriculture. This sunni 33% is opposed to India although population of all other muslims in JK is 69 %.

Shias (12%), Gujjars Muslims (14%), Pahadi Muslims ( 8%), Buddhists , Pandits, Sufis, Christians and Jammu Hindus/ Dogras ( aprox 45%) are totally opposed to separatism and Pakistan.

Stone pelting , Hoisting of Pakistani flags & Anti India demonstrations are held in just 5 Districts in Kashmir valley.

Other 17 districts have never participated in such activities.

Poonch and Kargil have above 90% Muslim population. There has never been an Anti India or separatist protest in these districts.

It is only the Anti National Media and other Anti India forces who with their own nefarious designs have created an impression that "WHOLE J&K" is against India.

Whereas the truth is that  just 15% of the Population comprising Sunni Muslims inhabiting 5 Districts of Kashmir province are fanning the separatist activities.

Please spread this message to every INDIAN to UNITE and SAVE the Sovereignty of Our Nation and Defeat the Nefarious Designs of Pakistan and root out terrorism.

Jai Hind

Thanx to Prakash Katoch for the fabulous post

ಯಾರೋ ಹೇಳಿದರು ಬಿಯರ್ ಕುಡಿ. ಸ್ಟೋನ್ ಹೋಗುತ್ತದೆ ಎಂದು.

  ಸ್ಟೋನ್ ಹೋಗಿ ತುಂಬಾ ದಿನ ಆಗಿದೆ.

ಈಗ   ಕಿಡ್ನಿಯು ಹೋಗುವ ಹಂತದಲ್ಲಿದೆ.

26/02/2019, 8:30 am - Lola Infosys: Seeing girls put up #girlpower tags and posting Oscar wins of women. Is it that women got more awards than men? If so , is it because of constant whining of feminists? Or is it because of actual talent? If it is because of talent, appreciate it, but I don't see why #girlpower is needed, coz #boypower was never a thing till now.

28/02/2019, 3:47 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: And, you don't know that few Indian cities have nuclear shield
28/02/2019, 3:48 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: And Pakistan lost 2 times with india, why didn't they launched nuclear 'in the verge of losing' ?

28/02/2019, 4:08 pm - Anni jss: Naga or anybody is scared to nuclear bomb cos, no sane person in Pakistan as well launch it. If at all the keys for the nuclear bomb lands in the hands of a terrorist, they are fanatics, they have nothing to loose, they will launch it
28/02/2019, 4:08 pm - Lola Infosys: If we reclaim pok, then China is blocked by direct India n afgan borders. They can't do trade with middle East . So they will either support pak or stop war from happening
28/02/2019, 4:08 pm - Anni jss: Yes
28/02/2019, 4:11 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: No actual pic available anywhere. 

I heard it will be kept in submarine or far somewhere for safety purposes, these media will show like bomb is now in Imran Khan basement.
28/02/2019, 4:11 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: That's rarely going to happen, Afghan was once far more dangerous than Pakistan.

Look at them now.
28/02/2019, 4:12 pm - Anni jss: As per my common sense, all nuclear or any missiles won't be kept in one place...there will be multiple launch pads for every missle.
28/02/2019, 4:12 pm - Anni jss: Afghan was never a nuclear warhead country.. they were only having guns, some rocket launchers.. Pakistan is different
28/02/2019, 4:13 pm - Anni jss: I believe nuke is not in control of imran as well.. someone in their army or general will have the power to exercise it.. PM or president in Pak is dummy
28/02/2019, 4:13 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Even without nuclear weapons, they were far more Dangerous than any.
28/02/2019, 4:14 pm - Anni jss: That was cos they were good in guerrilla warfare.. guerrilla is dangerous when you are facing the enemy head on.. but nuke can be launched from the place where u are sitting
28/02/2019, 4:15 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: It's like Pak waited till modi to plant bomb.

Kargil war was the biggest defeat for Pak, avaglu terrosism ittu ivaglu ide.

Innen soltare and takshna nuclear hakbidtare annodella dubak
28/02/2019, 4:15 pm - Lola Infosys: As per Hollywood movies ,launch keys will be with 2 different ppl and they need to put it and press buttons together. Not just with pm. And launch pads will be far off, subs, hills, farms, unexpected places
28/02/2019, 4:15 pm - Anni jss: During Kargil, I think both India and Pakistan were not nuclear warheads.. it's only after Kargil, both became nuclear states
28/02/2019, 4:16 pm - Anni jss: Yeah..
28/02/2019, 4:17 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: If I were to encourage your statements, even if they trigger nuclear weapons, india has nuclear shields, ballistic programs.  Which will Destroy the missile at minimal loss
28/02/2019, 4:17 pm - Anni jss: It's not that soltaare anta gotaadaaga they will surely launch.. fanatics can do anything is the point.  Their mind is not stable.. that is what the case is
28/02/2019, 4:17 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Pak had, India also had. But both were tested it long back so no one was trusting one another
28/02/2019, 4:17 pm - Lola Infosys: Yes. Israel tech. That dome shield program which they bought. Automatically it will launch counter missiles n destroy in air
28/02/2019, 4:18 pm - Anni jss: Yeah that is their.. India has capability to destroy a missle mid air, but we shouldn't go to that extent
28/02/2019, 4:19 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: I'm still saying, it's not a child game.

We may not know what are all the equipment internally placed.

And what are all the international territories take precautions to avoid these kinds.

We won't be knowing any confidential things placed
28/02/2019, 4:20 pm - Anni jss: Totally agreed, but we shouldn't go to that extent

28/02/2019, 4:24 pm - Nagendra: We all feel if it's war its bad.. u r the only one telling as if nothing happens
28/02/2019, 4:24 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Pak army is 1/4 of Indian army
28/02/2019, 4:24 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: They lost 2 wars, 3rd one of they do this
28/02/2019, 4:25 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: They will lose POK which was given by congress to them
28/02/2019, 4:25 pm - Anni jss: Arun, conventional war, everyone knows India will win. It's the fickle mind of Pak which India is worried about
28/02/2019, 4:25 pm - Nagendra: U r blind leave it
28/02/2019, 4:26 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: For fickle minds it was easy to attack India before 2014 , not now.

Saama, daana, bedha, danda.


Pak is doing the third plan called Bedha, ashte
28/02/2019, 4:26 pm - Anni jss: But It doesn't mean, India should be worried and de-escalate.. India needs to be positive and attack them when time is right
28/02/2019, 4:27 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Our media wants news, if you guys have seen Kannada channels, they are provoking people to do war like anything
28/02/2019, 4:28 pm - Nagendra: U r simply connecting media Congress n all..
28/02/2019, 4:29 pm - Nagendra: Just think of two countries war and people

28/02/2019, 4:29 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: I said 10% about congress, all I did was replying to all your messages
28/02/2019, 4:30 pm - Nagendra: Ur replies are more driven politically than normal
28/02/2019, 4:31 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: 1st of nuclear bomb hakbitre, they know they also won't be surviving, Pakistan or take any jihadis they don't have any meter.

Only they will convert few young fellows and make them attack us.

02/03/2019, 10:30 pm - Lola Infosys: Aruna spotted
02/03/2019, 10:50 pm - Anni jss: What has happened on Feb 27th (as per one of my IAF friend)..Minute by Minute details 
9:52 AM – Indian Netra and Northern Air command detected ten F16 took off from 3 Airbases from Pakistan. They came in 3 groups and merged in attack formation near POK. 
9:54: AM – India scrambled 2 Mig21 bisons and 4 Sukoi MKi to intercept 10 PAK F16 
9.58 AM – India sounded alert to PAF fighters that, you are about to encroach Indian air space. Please evade. 
9.59 AM – India sounded alert # 2  to PAF with IFAC protocols and they didn’t respond 
10:00 AM - PAF violates Indian airspace. With Swarm merge attack formation (which is tactical in nature) 
10:01 AM - Nine F16 forced to deviate path and within 1 KM of airspace they returned to POK side after heavy surface to air ground artillery and valiant fight from our Sukoi and Migs. 
10:02 AM -  One PAK F16 went deep inside Indian territory probably 3 KMs to destroy an Oil storage at an army brigade HQ 
10:03 AM – One IAF Sukoi and one Mig 21 Bison (Flt Lt Abhinandan Varthaman) continued engaging the F16 in a dog fight maneuver called “Defensive split”. Mig 21 was in the front, then F16 and then a sukoi. Due to firing from sukoi, F16 flee the scene using a dog fight maneuver called “wingover”. 
10:04 AM – Sukoi hovered around oil field guarding it and Mig 21 Bison (Wg Cdr Abhinandan) chased F16 out of Indian territory. While chasing he engaged F16 in a lock-in position for his onboard R-73 air to air missile to be deployed. 
Here you have to applaud the courage of Abhinandan. He could have returned to base. But if he returns to base then the missile lock in would have been disengaged (due to out of radar coverage) and he will not be able to shoot F16 down. So he decided to chase him down to POK and shoot him down. 
10:08 AM – He engaged his R73 missile that hit the F16 and drowned him 
10:08 AM – After shooting him down he performed a highly dangerous maneuver called “High-g barrel roll”. He had to do this because he had been in the vicinity of PAK surface to air artillery and SAM. While doing so he has to vertically climb at high speed and reverse its direction towards India. While doing so his old outdated Mig 21 bison’s engine thrust had a problem and he became almost non-maneuverable for few secs. And during that time either a SAM or air artillery hit his plane. 

So people should understand what has happened. Not upgrading or replacing the ageing jets and just upgrading radar and avionics doesn’t give you the edge. 
It requires a huge piloting skills, ability and courage to drown a F16 with a Mig21. 

So salute to Abhinandan

"The high-resolution images don't show any evidence of bomb damage," he said. Lewis viewed three other high-resolution Planet Labs pictures of the site taken within hours of the image provided to Reuters.

11/03/2019, 9:49 am - Vishak: I don't want my country to be joke with changing PM's like 90s
11/03/2019, 9:50 am - Theja: This time no one will get majority.
There will be a king maker from third front

11/03/2019, 1:16 pm - Vishak: Theja getting confident of his prediction👆
11/03/2019, 1:18 pm - Lola Infosys: Caste based won't work. They don't deserve development . All the yojanas should be removed
11/03/2019, 1:19 pm - Vishak: Thing is it comes to wats in it for me
11/03/2019, 1:21 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: That's why BJP 100 in KAR

11/03/2019, 1:22 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: There is only one reason for BJP to lose i.e. Negative Propaganda of Media and Left wing
11/03/2019, 1:27 pm - Abhilash: As the poll suggests, people based on certain caste want him as PM.

Not people who need nation development
11/03/2019, 1:28 pm - Vishak: Ya
11/03/2019, 1:32 pm - Theja: Yeah but I have got people mindset rite
11/03/2019, 1:33 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: It's wrong, being educated we must educate them while we can to lead them right
11/03/2019, 1:34 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: To be frank, I'm spreading msg to as many people I can, explaining them about generic medicine, PMJay, train 18, Awas Yojana etc
11/03/2019, 1:36 pm - Abhilash: Yes, cos you are the ppl who need certain castes to have favoured over nation
11/03/2019, 1:39 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Just imagine if congress comes to power, so many terrorists attack inside country, and gaandus like RG won't retaliate also
11/03/2019, 1:50 pm - Lola Infosys: Actually this poll is fake. Majority of Muslims vote modi. Only pure arabic saabi anti hindu goat fuckers hate modi ashte
11/03/2019, 1:51 pm - Abhilash: Hmmm
11/03/2019, 1:52 pm - Theja: Equity for all 
Evident nation has progressed
11/03/2019, 1:52 pm - Lola Infosys: But yea that poll on Caste , can't say same. They have selfish needs. Not development
11/03/2019, 1:54 pm - Lola Infosys: Education, free food, ration, jobs . So much reservations from 70 yrs. Still they say they are oppressed. It's mindset ashte. They are enjoying life aaramse otherwise
11/03/2019, 1:55 pm - Abhilash: Favouring is not equality theja
Wake up
11/03/2019, 1:55 pm - Lola Infosys: 35% marks get job guarantee. But not 60% marks. Their job quality will reflect in this. How will jobs progress then
11/03/2019, 1:56 pm - Vishak: No it's termed used by leftist on equity
11/03/2019, 1:56 pm - Vishak: Equality vs equity
11/03/2019, 1:56 pm - Lola Infosys: They have everything to get 60%. Still enjoy benefits and get only 35%. Totally wrong
11/03/2019, 1:58 pm - Abhilash: I am just asking if a guy with mere percentage got  into MBBS and became a doc, will u prefer going to him ?
11/03/2019, 1:58 pm - Vishak: But that logic of equity even feminist use a lot
11/03/2019, 1:58 pm - Lola Infosys: Lol.. make it mandatory to show pass percentage of doctors or on their name plates
11/03/2019, 1:59 pm - Vishak: But is proven to be assumed logic
11/03/2019, 1:59 pm - Lola Infosys: For*
11/03/2019, 1:59 pm - Lola Infosys: Wats equity in this scenario.. not getting the meaning.
11/03/2019, 2:00 pm - Vishak: <Media omitted>
11/03/2019, 2:00 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Lol
11/03/2019, 2:00 pm - Vishak: So he is assuming brahmins are tat tall guy n SC is tat short guy
11/03/2019, 2:00 pm - Abhilash: 😄 obviously we will tell , ayy avnu reservation Alli bandironu, yavonu hogtane,

Similarly the society need able docs to keep it healthy
Period
11/03/2019, 2:01 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Tall guy is the one who has everything but still asking reservation
11/03/2019, 2:01 pm - Vishak: 😄😄😄
11/03/2019, 2:01 pm - Lola Infosys: Even I was abt to say same
11/03/2019, 2:01 pm - Vishak: Ya that's wat assumed logic
11/03/2019, 2:04 pm - Lola Infosys: I agree equity is required. But  after few yrs of this logic, short guy grows tall with all the favors. Next Will he stop accepting the favors and give it to still shorter ppl than him? No. He still keeps it. Thats is the wrong mindset. I want to enjoy equity irrespective if I grow tall and can manage, I still want free favors.
11/03/2019, 2:04 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: The people who took reservation should do something for the society, atleast for their community. But no one doing it
11/03/2019, 2:05 pm - Vishak: Exactly
11/03/2019, 2:05 pm - Lola Infosys: I have seen many ppl among SC/Muslims, rich guys, SUVs, imported cars, many bungalows. Still showing certificate and enjoying favors
11/03/2019, 2:05 pm - Lola Infosys: 👍🏼
11/03/2019, 2:06 pm - Lola Infosys: Equity shud be short term. Take favor, grow own balls, leave it for others to grow.
11/03/2019, 2:08 pm - Lola Infosys: Average daily pay of temple pujaris in Bangalore is 120₹ per day. They won't get favors despite being poor, why? Coz they are Brahmins. Logic
11/03/2019, 2:08 pm - Lola Infosys: I think someone shared link here , of this
11/03/2019, 2:12 pm - Vishak: Ya correct if ur poor ur weak need support which ever caste u r. And if ur rich u don't need or can't expect which ever caste u r
11/03/2019, 2:15 pm - Abhilash: Eggactly
11/03/2019, 2:26 pm - Lola Infosys: So it comes down to economical/financial based favors.
11/03/2019, 2:27 pm - Lola Infosys: But 'few' ppl oppose this 😅
11/03/2019, 2:32 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: 😅
11/03/2019, 2:33 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Still able to get 10%
11/03/2019, 2:33 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Relax for those who deserved
11/03/2019, 2:47 pm - Lola Infosys: State is given option to change it. But like the recent MP , only caste % is increased. Not this 10
11/03/2019, 2:52 pm - Lola Infosys: <Media omitted>
11/03/2019, 2:52 pm - Lola Infosys: So Moslems won't won't. Bjp wins 😂 so much for the poll
11/03/2019, 2:53 pm - Vishak: 😄
11/03/2019, 2:53 pm - Lola Infosys: Won't vote*
11/03/2019, 2:53 pm - Vishak: Wat won't vote they are active voters
11/03/2019, 2:54 pm - Vishak: They make 10 babies for 10 votes🤭
11/03/2019, 2:56 pm - Lola Infosys: I meant as joke. Some of them saying don't keep during Ramzan. So for them Religion is greater than nation. Secular 🙄
11/03/2019, 3:02 pm - Theja: In Indian education topper is not the best practical guy.

Also reg poor Brahmin , politicians see mass. 2.5 % out of 3 % are already rich. .5 % votes doesn't matter. That's why they concentrate mass.
11/03/2019, 3:06 pm - Lola Infosys: 5% brahmin. 20% obc. Total population. So according to this they shud be given full reservations
11/03/2019, 3:06 pm - Lola Infosys: Comments for this?

ರಾಮನು ಭರತನನ್ನು ಗಾಢವಾಗಿ ತಬ್ಬಿಕೊಂಡು ಅತ್ತ ದಿನ ಅವರಿಬ್ಬರಲ್ಲೂ ಪ್ರೇಮಾಶ್ರುವು ಉಕ್ಕಿ ನದಿಯಾಗಿ ಹರಿದು ಭಾವ ಸೌಂದರ್ಯದ ಗರಿಮೆಯನ್ನು ಮುಟ್ಟಿದಂತೆ, ಪ್ರತೀ ಜೀವಿಯೂ ಭಾವ ಸೌಂದರ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಮೆರೆದರೆ ಅದು ಜೀವಕ್ಕೆ ಹಿತ ಎಂದು ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾರೆ ಮಾನ್ಯ ಗುಂಡಪ್ಪನವರು ಈ ಮುಕ್ತಕದಲ್ಲಿ.

೧. ಕೋಸಿ ನದಿ:
ಇದು ಹಿಮಾಲಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಹುಟ್ಟಿ ಬಿಹಾರದ ಮೂಲಕ ಹರಿದು ಗಂಗಾ ನದಿಯನ್ನು ಸೇರುತ್ತದೆ.
೨. ದೇವಕುಮಾರಧಾರಾ :
ಇದು ಹಾಸನದಲ್ಲಿ ಹುಟ್ಟಿ ಮಂಡ್ಯ , ರಾಮನಗರ, ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು, ಮೈಸೂರು ಹಾಗೂ ಸುತ್ತ ಮುತ್ತಲಿನ ಪ್ರದೇಶಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಹರಿದು, ಮುಗ್ಧ ( ಮುಠ್ಠಾಳ ಅಲ್ಲ) ಜನರ ಹೃದಯ ಸೇರಿ, ಅಪಾರ ಪ್ರಮಾಣದಲ್ಲಿ ಹಣ, ಮುತ್ತು, ರತ್ನ, ಮಣ್ಣು ಮರಳನ್ನು ತನ್ನ ಒಡಲಾಳದಲ್ಲಿ ತುಂಬಿಕೊಂಡು ಮತ್ತೆ ಹಾಸನವನ್ನು ಸೇರುತ್ತದೆ.
😆😆

ದೇವಕುಮಾರಾಧಾರ ಉಪನದಿಗಳು,

ನಿಖಿಲ್ ಧಾರಾ,
ಪ್ರಜ್ವಲ್ ಧಾರಾ,
ಅನಿತಾವತಿ,
ಭವಾನಿ

ಮತ್ತೊಂದು  ಚಿಕ್ಕ ಝರಿ ರಾಧಿಕಾವತಿ ಇದೆ ಕುಮಾರಧಾರ  ದ ಉಪನದಿ ಅಂತ ಹೇಳಬಹುದು.

It's the only place in Kerala with more than 40% Muslim population.

It's a district in Kerala, from where 5 Muslims escaped to *Syria* to join *ISIS* Terrorist organization.

It's the only district in Kerala, where no other religious celebrations take place on a large scale, other than  *Ramzan and Bakr-Id*.

It's the first place in Kerala, where during every Friday namaz the *Muslim clerics* openly call for the killings of Non- Muslims.
No authority in Kerala challenged it.

This is the place where *Rahul Gandhi* is fighting for a Lok-Sabha seat, other than from Amethi in UP

Now you know *WHY....?!*😡🤬✋🏿C M B ⛔🚫❌☠
03/04/2019, 9:24 am - Lola Infosys: Many congis confused with district and constituency. They don't know how to calculate population in both. 

Btw. It is based on 2011 census, n we know muslims reproduce in mass. If we take current scenario, Muslims are majority in many states. But govt not disclosing coz they will lose minority status

03/04/2019, 5:01 pm - Vishak: One for Hindus other for minoroties
03/04/2019, 5:02 pm - Lola Infosys: If both did same thing. Remove it from discussion. Don't talk one sided. Else talk on both sides.
03/04/2019, 5:02 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Is Modi asked Brahmins to vote for only them ? Or any particular religion,
.

Last year went to Wayanad trip. Every where this Paki type muslim flags. Every street ,shop, farms , hotels, etc. It was not election time or any. Why to display that? I felt I was in Pak only. Never saw any hindu related flags there.

Here if you put Hanuman flag, om flag or some hindu flags, you will be in ndtv breaking news next day as saffron terror.

05/04/2019, 10:27 am - Anni jss: If national is security is already there, why govt will still work on defense, security continuously?

05/04/2019, 10:37 am - Vishak: U can't expect all to b skilled
05/04/2019, 10:37 am - Lola Infosys: Whatever we read in engg 20% only is used in jobs. Rest one should do own research n learn. You think everyone do this?? Reskilling?
05/04/2019, 10:38 am - Vishak: See if u studied engineering and failed also basic some knowledge u will have
05/04/2019, 10:38 am - Anni jss: Yes skill is the most important thing now.. nobody is looking at people who are unskilled.. if companies wont take unskilled people what can govt do
05/04/2019, 10:38 am - Nagendra: Why not.. what stopping people to become skilled other than their mind set ?
05/04/2019, 10:39 am - Lola Infosys: Now don't say companies should give reservations. If ppl don't clear interviews, they are not skillful ashte. No one can blame govt or company

05/04/2019, 10:40 am - Anni jss: Panda talking senseless.. I'm stopping here
05/04/2019, 10:40 am - Vishak: How to tell a guy who studied engineering can't work as sweeper
05/04/2019, 10:40 am - Nagendra: Take Ur bro as example .. isn't he self motivated or is govt motivating him?? .. both u and him are equally capable.. Ur choices led to Ur job.. his choices let to his job ..
05/04/2019, 10:41 am - Theja: Let's go by fact.

05/04/2019, 11:04 am - Nagendra: Ashte theja we have always told RG beda ashte.. if Modi was in Congress we would have voted Congress only may be .. RG becoming PM or mayavati n all.. it's disastrous
05/04/2019, 11:04 am - Anni jss: If RG was of same or similar stature as modi, then could have thought.. I don't mind dynasty politics unless they are good..
05/04/2019, 11:06 am - Theja: Mayawathi is under rated. She has won in UP with no dynasty and God father.
05/04/2019, 11:07 am - Anni jss: At the end of the day, person becoming PM matters.. if he is good, then, dynasty, religion, race, dalit, brahmin should not matter..

05/04/2019, 4:45 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Without full majority it's waste,

05/04/2019, 4:46 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: It's most interesting than any other ever
05/04/2019, 4:46 pm - Vishak: In our group only one vote down

1. There are many benefit schemes by modi like for middle class, for defense people, for Muslim women, for farmers(though little),women in general as well,many other sections.. if these people who really got benefitted, votes for bjp, they bjp might even break all records.. like how rajiv did

05/04/2019, 4:49 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: RBI cuts the interest rate for loans.

Let's say you had a home loan of ₹30,00,000 for 20 years, with 8.4%.
EMI = ₹25,845. 

With this week's rate cut, expect 8.15% bank rate, which means, the monthly EMI = ₹25,374. 
You now save ₹5,652 per year, which is good! Celebrate 🙌
05/04/2019, 4:50 pm - Vishak: ??

👉 If you find that someone has already cast your vote, then ask for "tender vote" and cast your vote.
👉If any polling booth records more than 14% tender votes, repolling will be conducted in such poling booth.
👉 Please share this very important message with maximum groups and friends as everyone should aware of their right to vote 👏👏

10/04/2019, 12:28 pm - Lola Infosys: One point for equity. You have told many times , your caste has got so much jobs in govt jobs like pwd n all. Even mla seats etc. You have told your relatives only there. You also said they have not helped fellow caste ppl. So now, will they give up equity n reservations now since they are benefitted from it in past and give equity to other needy? #justasking
10/04/2019, 12:29 pm - Lola Infosys: So community is full of greedy ppl according to you. Always want equity, but won't give up for needy??

The biggest offset partner 
in Rafale deal is *DRDO* 
with *₹9,000* crore, &
*Not Ambani.* 

Rest *₹21,000* is split in three main manufacturers!.
*Thales ₹6,300 crore,* 
*Dassault ₹8,400 crore &* 
*Safran ₹6,300 crore!*

*Offset for Thales is given to 12 Indian companies.*
*Offset for Dassault to 55 Indian companies!* 

*And offset for Safran to 22 Indian companies!*

*Ambani's Reliance is one of these 89 companies, clocking only about 3% of the total i.e. around ₹900 crore!*

Guess who else is there? 

*Among the known ones, L&T, Mahindra, HCL, TCS, Cap Gemini India, Titan, Wipro & Godrej!*

*To add a cherry to the cake, HAL is there too, via a JV (Joint Venture) with Safran!*

*So everything Pappu is saying, is bullshit  he knows it!*
*He thinks Indians are still fools like from his dad's & grandma's times!*

*Share it maximum.  Translate in the languages you may know!*

*No media will do this!*

*Social media is the only hope!*

17/04/2019, 4:19 pm - Lola Infosys: One night a guy goes to get a room in a hotel. "Hello, I want a single room for the night please." "Fine, sir, here's one of our best rooms. Room 13," says the concierge and hands him the key. The guy goes upstairs, takes a shower and gets straight into bed. At about 2 0'clock in the morning, two gorgeous naked women come in and slide under the covers. When he realizes what is going on, he starts screwing both of them. He can't believe what's happening. Next morning, still surprised by last night's events, he goes downstairs to settle the bill. "How was your room sir?" asks the receptionist. "Excellent, I will come back again. What do I owe you?" asks the man. 
"Well. actually, sir, we are doing a promotional offer. Not only do you not have to pay but we give you $10 as a welcome gesture," says the receptionist. "What?" says the guy, very surprised indeed. "That's amazing." He takes the ten-dollar bill and wanders off, debating whether his buddies will believe him or not. Needless to say, after a few days he's told all his friends and neighbors about room 13 and the amazing night of passion. The next week one of his buddies goes to check out the room. "Room 13 please." "Certainly, sir, here's your key." After he gets in bed, at the same time, 2 o'clock, three girls this time, extremely horny, get in bed and screw his brains out. The next morning, not only does he not have to pay, but he too gets $10. After a month, everyone knows this hotel and especially room 13. Everyone that stays in room 13 gets the same treatment: a good screw and a ten bucks. 
After a few weeks, the story reaches the President. The President decides to check the story out for himself. He visits the hotel and asks for room 13. He gets the keys and goes upstairs. After a couple of drinks he gets in bed waiting patiently for the naked girls to appear. Indeed at about 2 0'clock in the morning two naked ladies come to bed. They are as horny and wild as all the stories the President has heard. The President gets his pecker out and screws both of them all night long. This is the night of his life. Next morning he goes to reception and when he asks how much the bill is, the receptionist says, "Nothing to pay, sir. Actually, we are doing an introductory offer. Here's $50 as a welcome gesture." Curious, the President asks the receptionist, "Well, that's strange. Everyone else who comes here gets $10. Why do I get $50?" "Well, sir," says the receptionist. "This is the first time we've filmed a porn movie with a President in it!"

Nothing is free in this World...
Don't sell yourself, unknowingly.

24/04/2019, 5:46 pm - Theja: It's not about Constitution. Amendment is required. It's about corrupt judge.
24/04/2019, 5:47 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Have you read constitution, let me send the copy I have in my computer.

24/04/2019, 5:56 pm - Nagendra: Teja rise as Arun questions Bhim constitution😅
24/04/2019, 5:57 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: It's like me being ramya asking others to vote.
24/04/2019, 5:58 pm - Theja: Nothing he has right to express.

24/04/2019, 6:10 pm - Theja: No . I know about myself.

28/04/2019, 4:59 pm - Lola Infosys: Lays vs. farmers, the stuff you don't know:
1. The patented potatoes in question are moisture less dry potatoes that cannot be consumed and can only be used to make confectionary products like potato chips. So the farmers wouldn't be selling this potato to the people but to pepsicos's competitors  since it's a B2B exclusive product.

2. The farmers in question are 4 landed farmers in Gujarat who are financially and socially powerful owning acres of land. They are using their influence to pit the people against lays to cover up their own theft. 

3. Yes, Theft. Because the genetically modified seed is only issued to those farmers in contract with PepsiCo and if other farmers get access to it, and start selling those potatoes to lays's competitors the hundreds of farmers in contract with lays will loose their exclusivity and profit margins. 

By suing said farmers PepsiCo is protecting the interest of hundreds of farmers who are contractually employed by the company. PepsiCo also has legal ground for these claims following legislations of intellectual property and company rights.

Yes PepsiCo is a capitalist MNC whose first priority is its profit. But still the story is not poor farmers vs PepsiCo. The farmers who were sued have jeopardized hundreds of smaller farmers in contract with PepsiCo. It is a story of rich influential people playing victim to hide their crime and of you falling victim to propaganda. Don't believe everything you see in the internet and do check the facts.

ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು ಇದರ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಎಚ್ಚರಿಕೆ ವಹಿಸಿ...

ಈ ವಿಷಯವನ್ನು ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಶೇರ್ ಮಾಡಿ....

A Doctor was relaxing on his sofa one evening just after arriving home from work. As he was tuning into the evening news, the phone rang.

"We have already opened an aged scotch

As he was moving out, his wife asked, "Is it serious?"

09/05/2019, 8:08 am - Nagendra: The Japanese government has decided to dispose of all the " *microwave ovens*" in the country before the end of this year n all citizens n organizations that do not meet the requirement, are threatened with fines n prison terms.

The reason for the ban on "microwave ovens" in the land of the Rising Sun was a research by scientists from the University of Hiroshima, where they discovered that "radio waves" cause greater harm to the health of citizens over 20 years, especially when using microwave oven which is more harmful than the American atomic bombs on Hiroshima n Nagasaki in Sept 1945.

According to experts, food heated in a microwave oven has very unhealthy vibrations and radiation.

Indeed, all the largest manufacturers of "microwave ovens" in Japan are being closed where this product is manufactured.

In 2021, the production of "microwave ovens" will be stopped, as announced in South Korea, and China plans to abandon this type of technology in 2023.

A conference on cancer prevention was held at the Kashira Cancer Center n the recommendations made at the end of the conference was, these foodstuffs should be avoided:
1. Refined oil
2. Milk of animal origin (recommended soy milk)
3. Food cubes (chicken broth spices like Maggie and the like)
4. Soda (32 pieces of sugar per liter)
5. *Refined sugar*
6. Microwave ovens
7. Do not perform mammogram before birth, except echocardiography
8. Very narrow underwear n bra
9. Alcohol
10. Dissolving iced food and then refreezing it
11. Drinking water from the refrigerator in plastic bottles
12. Pills because it changes the hormonal system in women and causes cancer
13. Special deodorants when used after shaving because they cause cancer
14. *White Sugar* in any form (cancer cells feed mainly on sugar). Cancer patients should avoid sugar from their diet.

According to the recommendations of the conference, they advise to add these to your diet :
1. Vegetables
2. Honey moderately used instead of sugar
3. Plant proteins (beans instead of meat)
4. Two cups of water at body temperature on an empty stomach before brushing teeth
5. The food should be warm and not very hot
6. Aloe vera juice + ginger + parsley + celery + bromalin. We recommend mixing them and drinking them on an empty stomach
7. Carrot juice every day
8. Tomato, garlic n onion with meals

Note :
The American Physicians Association found answers to the cause of cancer:
1. Do not drink tea, coffee or anything hot in plastic cups
2. Do not eat anything hot wrapped in paper or cardboard or in a plastic bag (for example: fried potatoes)
3. Do not eat in plastic or microwave dishes

We wish to note the following:
When plastic is exposed to heat, chemical compounds that can cause 52 kinds of cancer are released.

Thus, you must avoid drinking all kinds of soft drinks such as "Cola, Pepsi, Av, Fanta n all concentrated juices.

Eat fresh pineapples and avoid pineapple juice mixture with Cola because this mixture is deadly as it will cause death to people as they think the reason is poisoning and they are the victims of their ignorance of this deadly cocktail!

Respond to calls through the left ear and better use headphones

Do not drink medicines with cold water

Do not eat heavy food after 7pm

Drink more water in the morning n less in the evening
Do not take a horizontal position (lying down/sleep) immediately after eating

When your phone battery is almost dead, do not pick up the phone, because this radiation is 1000 times stronger than the charged battery.

When Rahul Kanwal asked him what were his plans for the second term, Gadkariji said, "in the first term we concentrated a lot on highways - in the second term, we will concentrate on waterways - my first job would be to link Godavari and Krishna and thus bring water to Tamilnadu, which is facing repeated water problems"

What a man ! only yesterday, the whole Tamilnadu had voted totally against BJP, still the first plan he has is for the development of Tamilnadu !!

This is the party that TN has failed to recognize !!

27/05/2019, 1:16 pm - Nagendra: Banro tea kudkond hoddadana 🤣
27/05/2019, 1:17 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: If you take Sriramulu, he did not steal money from government. He did not pay tax, even Reddy, it's called cheating to government not called corruption. Corruption is what CONgress so, taking money which are already sanctioned for public work,

BSY did I agree, Karnataka MLA election happens now, I still have doubt BSY will come to power.

But congress has people like BSY allover
27/05/2019, 1:18 pm - Arun Bhadardwaj: Modi is BJP national leader, he did not do, he protects nation and monitor work to be completed within tenure. Pratap Simha did some awesome work here, enough for me to vote.

Rahul tried hard and increase his seats from 44 to 52 which is 18% increase. Tremendous growth achieved over LY

Modi is just able to increase from 282 to 303 which is mere 7.5%.

*APPRAISAL Grade* -

*After apprisal Rahul awarded 3 week paid holidays and a trip to Italy.........And Modi was sent back to work hard and achieve more in next 5 years by improving his efficiency*😊😊

*ದುರ್ಯೋಧನ* ಮತ್ತು *ರಾಹುಲ್*
ಇಬ್ಬರೂ ದಡ್ಡರು. ಆದರೆ ಹುಟ್ಟಿನಿಂದಲೇ ಈ ಭಾರತವನ್ನಾಳಬೇಕೆಂದು ಬಯಸುತ್ತಾರೆ.

*ಭೀಷ್ಮ* ಮತ್ತು *ಅಡ್ವಾನಿ*
ಇಬ್ಬರಿಗೂ ಚಕ್ರವರ್ತಿ ಯಾಗುವ ಅರ್ಹತೆ ಯಿದ್ದರೂ ಸಿಂಹಾಸನ ಏರಲಾಗಲಿಲ್ಲ.  ಸಂದಿಗ್ದ ಸಂದರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿ ಏನೂ ಮಾಡಲಾಗಲಿಲ್ಲ.

*ಅರ್ಜುನ* ಮತ್ತು *ನರೇಂದ್ರ ಮೋದಿ*
ಇಬ್ಬರೂ ಮೇಧಾವಿಗಳು. ಧರ್ಮದಿಂದ ಮೇಲೇರಿದರೂ ಅದಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ತುಂಬಾ ಶ್ರಮಪಟ್ಟರು.

*ಕರ್ಣ* ಮತ್ತು *ಮನಮೋಹನ್ ಸಿಂಗ್*
ಇಬ್ಬರೂ ಬುದ್ದಿವಂತರು.  ಆದರೂ ಅಧರ್ಮದ ಕಡೆ ಇದ್ದದರಿಂದ ಉನ್ನತಿಯನ್ನು ಏರಲಾಗಲಿಲ್ಲ.

*ಶಕುನಿ* ಮತ್ತು *ಕೇಜ್ರಿವಾಲ್*
ಇಬ್ಬರೂ ಯಾವುದೇ ಯುದ್ಧವನ್ನು ಮಾಡದೆ ತಮ್ಮ ಕೆಟ್ಟ ನಡೆಗಳಿಂದ ಆರಕ್ಕೇರದೆ ಮೂರಕ್ಕಿಳಿಯದೆ ಹಾಗೆ ಉಳಿದರು

*ಧೃತರಾಷ್ಟ್ರ* ಮತ್ತು *ಸೋನಿಯಾ* ಮತ್ತು *ದೇವೇಗೌಡ*
ಮಕ್ಕಳ ಮೇಲಿನ ಅಂಧಾಭಿಮಾನದಿಂದ ಕುರುಡರಾಗೇ ವರ್ತಿಸಿದರು.

*ಧರ್ಮರಾಯ* ಮತ್ತು *ವಾಜಪೇಯಿ* ಸತ್ಯವಂತರು ಆದರೆ ಕುತಂತ್ರಿಗಳ ಮೋಸದಿಂದ ಪಗಡೆಯಾಟದಲ್ಲಿ ಸೋತರು

*ಶ್ರೀ ಕೃಷ್ಣ* ಮತ್ತು *ಅಬ್ದುಲ್ ಕಲಾಮ್*
ಇವರಿಬ್ಬರನ್ನೂ ನಾವು ಆರಾಧಿಸುತ್ತೇವೆ.  ಆದರೆ ಅವರಂತೆ ನಡೆಯಲು ನುಡಿಯಲು ಮನಸ್ಸಿಲ್ಲ

*ಇದೇ ಮಹಾಭಾರತ ಮತ್ತು ಇಂದಿನ ಭಾರತ*

*ಗಾಂಧಿ ಹತ್ಯೆಯ ನಂತರ ನಡೆದ ಕೋರ್ಟ್​ ವಿಚಾರಣೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಾನೇಕೆ ಗಾಂಧಿಯನ್ನು ಹತ್ಯೆ ಮಾಡಿದೆ ಎಂದು ಗೋಡ್ಸೆ ತನ್ನ ಪರ ವಾದವನ್ನು ಸವಿವರವಾಗಿ ಮಂಡಿಸಿದ್ದ, ಗಾಂಧಿ ಹತ್ಯೆಯನ್ನು ಸಮರ್ಥಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದ. ಗಾಂಧೀಜಿ ವಿರುದ್ಧ ಆತನ ತಕರಾರೆಂದರೆ...?*

*ಗಾಂಧಿ ಹತ್ಯೆಗೆ ನಾಥೂರಾಮ್ ಗೋಡ್ಸೆ ಕೋರ್ಟ್ನಲ್ಲಿ ಕೊಟ್ಟಿದ್ದ 10 ಮುಖ್ಯ ಕಾರಣಗಳೇನು ಗೊತ್ತಾ...!*

*1. ಅಖಂಡ ಭಾರತ ನಿರ್ಮಾಣ ನನ್ನ ಕನಸು. ಗಾಂಧೀಜಿಯಿಂದಾಗಿ ದೇಶ ವಿಭಜನೆಯಾಗಿ ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನ ನಿರ್ಮಾಣವಾಯಿತು..!*

*2. ದೇಶದ ಮೂರನೇ ಒಂದು ಭಾಗ ಆಗಸ್ಟ್ 15, 1947ರಂದು ವಿದೇಶವಾಗಿ ಹೋಯಿತು. ಅದಕ್ಕೆ ಕಾರಣ ಗಾಂಧಿ...!*

*3. ದೇಶವೇ ಸಂಕಷ್ಟದಲ್ಲಿದ್ದಾಗ ಗಾಂಧೀಜಿ ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನಕ್ಕೆ 55 ಕೋಟಿ ಪರಿಹಾರ ಕೊಡಿ ಎಂದು ಉಪವಾಸಕ್ಕೆ ಕುಳಿತಿದ್ದರು ಇದು ಸರಿಯಲ್ಲ...!*

*4. ಗಾಂಧೀಜಿಯ ಮುಸ್ಲಿಂ ಓಲೈಕೆಯಿಂದಾಗಿಯೇ ದೇಶ ವಿಭಜನೆಯಾಗಿದ್ದು...!*

*5. ದೇಶ ವಿಭಜನೆಯಾಗಿ ಗಡಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹಿಂದೂಗಳ ಮಾರಣಹೋಮವಾಗುತ್ತಿದ್ದರೂ ಗಾಂಧಿ ಮೌನ ವಹಿಸಿದ್ದರು...!*

*6. ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನದಿಂದ ಬಂದ ಹಿಂದೂ ನಿರಾಶ್ರಿತರಿಂದ ತುಂಬಿ ಹೋಗಿದ್ದ ಮಸೀದಿ ಖಾಲಿ ಮಾಡಿ ಮುಸ್ಲಿಮರಿಗೆ ಜಾಗ ಕೊಡಿ ಎಂದು ಗಾಂಧಿ ಉಪವಾಸ ಕುಳಿತಿದ್ದರು...!*

*7. ದೇಶದಲ್ಲೇ ಉಳಿದುಕೊಂಡ ಮುಸ್ಲಿಮರಿಗೆ ಆಶ್ರಯ ನೀಡಬೇಕು ಎಂದು ಗಾಂಧಿ ಒತ್ತಾಯಿಸಿದರು...!*

*8. ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನದಿಂದ ಭಾರತಕ್ಕೆ ಬಂದ ನಿರಾಶ್ರಿತ ಹಿಂದೂಗಳ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಗಾಂಧಿ ಕಿಂಚಿತ್ತೂ ಕರುಣೆ ತೊರಲಿಲ್ಲ...!*

*9. ಗಾಂಧಿಯನ್ನು ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರಪಿತ ಎನ್ನುವುದಾದರೆ ಅವರು ಆ ಸ್ಥಾನವನ್ನು ಸರಿಯಾಗಿ ನಿಭಾಯಿಸಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಗಾಂಧಿ ಪಾಕಿಸ್ತಾನದ ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರಪಿತ...!*

*10. ಗಾಂಧಿ ಇಲ್ಲದ ಭಾರತ ಶಕ್ತಿಶಾಲಿಯಾಗುತ್ತದೆ ಎಂಬ ಕಾರಣಕ್ಕೆ ಗಾಂಧಿಯನ್ನು ಕೊಂದೆ..!*

19/06/2019, 12:41 pm - Hrushikesh: *Corporate joke* 

The marketing Director of Nescafe manages to meet with the Pope at the Vatican.

After receiving the papal blessing, the Nescafe official whispers: 'Your Eminence, I have some business to discuss. We at Nescafe have an offer for you. Nescafe is prepared to donate $100 million to the church if you change the Lord's Prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily coffee'."

The Pope looks outraged & thunders: "That is impossible. The Prayer is the word of the Lord. It must not be changed." 

"Well," says the Nescafe man somewhat chastened, "We anticipated your reluctance.
For this reason, and the importance of the Lord's prayer to all Catholics, we will increase our offer to $300 million. All we require is that you change the Lord's Prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily coffee'."

Again, even more sternly, the Pope replies, "That, my son, is impossible. For the prayer is the word of the Lord and it must not be changed."

Finally, the Nescafe Director says, "Your Holiness, we at Nescafe respect your adherence to the faith, we realise that tradition is essential to your beliefs, we fully understand the importance of the word of the Lord but we do have one final offer.

Please discuss it with your cardinals. We will donate $500 million to the great Catholic church if you could only change the Lord's
Prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily coffee'. 

Please, please consider it. And he leaves.

The next day the Pope convenes the College of Cardinals. 

"There is some Good news," he announces, "and some bad news !!"

'The good news is, he continues to a hushed assembly', ' that the Church will get $ 500 million."

"And what is the bad news, your Holiness?" asks a Cardinal.

"Sadly" says the Pope, We would have to lose the Britannia Account."
